<h2><br />PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book is put forward with much diffidence,
for I am well aware of its insufficiencies. My original
idea was to produce a work covering all the principles
of painting, but after many years spent in considering
the various recorded theories relating to &aelig;sthetic
problems, and in gathering materials to indicate
how the accepted principles have been applied, I
came to the conclusion that a single life is scarcely
long enough for the preparation of an exhaustive
treatise on the subject. Nevertheless, I planned a
work of much wider scope than the one now presented,
but various circumstances, and principally
the hindrance to research caused by the war, impelled
me to curtail my ambition. Time was fading,
and my purpose seemed to be growing very old. I
felt that if one has something to say, it is better to
say it incompletely than to run the risk of compulsory
silence. The book will be found little more than
a skeleton, and some of its sections, notably those
dealing with illusions in the art, contain only a few
suggestions and instances, but perhaps enough is
said to induce a measure of further inquiry into the
subject.</p>

<p>That part of the work dealing with the fine arts
generally is the result of long consideration of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
apparent contradictions involved in the numerous
suggested standards of art. In a little book on
<i>The Position of Landscape in Art</i> (published under
a nom de plume a few years ago), I threw out, as a
<i>ballon d'essai</i>, an idea of the proposition now elaborated
as the Law of General Assent, and I have been
encouraged to affirm this proposition more strongly
by the fact that its validity was not questioned in
any of the published criticism of the former work;
nor do I find reason to vary it after years of additional
deliberation. I have not before dealt with the other
propositions now put forward.</p>

<p>The notes being voluminous I have relegated them
to the end of the book, leaving the feet of the text
pages for references only.</p>

<p>Where foreign works quoted have been translated
into English, the English titles are recorded, and
foreign quotations are given in English, save in one
or two minor instances where the sense could not
be precisely rendered in translation.</p>

Pursuit (Frick Collection, New York).</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>This work, which is one of the celebrated Grasse series of
panels, offers a very fine example of the use of an ideal
head in a romantic subject. (See <a href="#Page_139">Page 139</a>.)</td></tr>

<tr><td class='subentry'>(a). Head from a statue of Chefren, a king of the 4th
Egyptian Dynasty, about 3000 <small>B.C.</small> (Cairo Museum.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>(b). Head from a fragmentary statuette of Babylonia,
dating about 2600 <small>B.C.</small> (Louvre: from Spearing's
"Childhood of Art.")</td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>The first head is generally regarded as the finest example of
Egyptian art extant, and certainly there was nothing
executed in Egypt to equal it during the thirty centuries
following the 5th Dynasty. The Babylonian head is the
best work of Chaldean art known to us, though there are
some fine fragments remaining from the period of about a
thousand years later. It will be observed that the tendency
of the art in both examples is towards the aims
achieved by the Greeks. (See <a href="#Page_7">Page 7</a>.)</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'><span class="smcap">Plate 2.&mdash;"Le Bon Dieu d'Amiens", in the
North Porch, Amiens Cathedral</span></td><td align='right'><a href="#Page_18">18</a></td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>This figure by a French sculptor of the thirteenth century,
was considered by Ruskin to be the finest ideal
of Christ in existence. It is another example of the
universality of ideals, for the head from the front view
might well have been modelled from a Grecian work of
the late fourth or early third century <small>B.C.</small> (See <a href="#Page_319">Page 319</a>.)</td></tr>

Venus of Praxiteles. (Vatican)</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></td><td align='right'><a href="#Page_30">30</a></td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>It is commonly agreed that this is the finest model in
existence after the great work of Praxiteles, which
itself has long disappeared. The figure as it now
stands at the Vatican, has the right arm restored, and
the hand is made to hold up some metallic drapery
with which the legs are covered, the beauty of the form
being thus seriously weakened. (See <a href="#Page_111">Pages 111 <i>et seq.</i></a>)</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'><span class="smcap">Plate 4.&mdash;Venus Anadyomene</span></td><td align='right'><a href="#Page_42">42</a></td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>(a). Ancient Greek sculpture from the design of Venus
in the celebrated picture of Apelles. (Formerly
Chessa Collection, now in New York.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>The immense superiority of the sculpture over the painting
(Plate 5), from the point of view of pure art, is
visible at a glance. It is an indication of the far-reaching
scope of the sculptor when executing ideals. (See
<a href="#Page_113">Page 113</a>.)</td></tr>

(Dresden Gallery)</span></td><td align='right'><a href="#Page_54">54</a></td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>This is the finest reposing Venus in existence in painting.
It was the model for the representation of the goddess
in repose used by Titian, and many other artists who
came after him. (See <a href="#Page_116">Page 116</a>.)</td></tr>

century <small>B.C.</small>, attributed to Scopas. (British Museum.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>(b). Small head in bronze of the third century <small>B.C.</small>
(Private Collection.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='subentry'>In each of these heads the artist has been successful in
maintaining the ideal, while indicating a suggestion of
the sorrowful resignation with which Grecian legend has
enveloped the mind picture of Demeter. Nevertheless,
even this slight departure from the established rule tends
to lessen the art, though in a very small degree. (See
<a href="#Page_122">Page 122</a>.)</td></tr>

<h2><br /><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In view of the many varied definitions of "Art"
which have been put forward in recent times, and
the equally diverse hypotheses advanced for the
solution of &aelig;sthetic problems relating to beauty, it
is necessary for one who discusses principles of art,
to state what he understands by the terms "Art"
and "Beauty."</p>

<p>Though having a widely extended general meaning,
the term "Art" in common parlance applies to the
fine arts only, but the term "Arts" has reference as
well to certain industries which have utility for their
primary object. This work considers only the fine
arts, and when the writer uses the term "Art" or
"Arts" he refers to one or more of these arts, unless
a particular qualification is added. The definition
of "Art" as applied to the fine arts, upon which
he relies, is "The production of beauty for the purpose
of giving pleasure," or as it is more precisely
put, "The beautiful representation of nature for the
purpose of giving disinterested pleasure." This is,
broadly, the definition generally accepted, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
certainly the understanding of art which has guided
the hands of all the creators of those great works in
the various arts before which men have bowed as
triumphs of human skill.</p>

<p>There has been no satisfactory definition of
"Beauty," nor can the term be shortly interpreted
until there is a general agreement as to what it
covers. Much of the confusion arising from the
contradictory theories of &aelig;stheticists in respect of
the perception of beauty is apparently due to the
want of separate consideration of emotional beauty
and beauty of mind, that is to say, the beauty of
sensorial effects and beauty of expression respectively.<a name="Eanchor_1" id="Eanchor_1"></a><a href="#Enote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
There are kinds of sensorial beauty which
depend for their perception upon immediately preceding
sensory experience, or particular coexistent
surroundings which are not necessarily permanent,
while in other cases a certain beauty may be recognized
and subsequently appear to vanish altogether.
From this it is obvious that any &aelig;sthetic system
based upon the existence of an objectivity of beauty
must fall to the ground. On the other hand, without
an objectivity there can be no system, because
in its absence a line of reasoning explaining cause
and effect in the perception of beauty, which is open
to demonstration, is naturally impossible. Nor may
we properly speak of a philosophy of art.<a name="Eanchor_2" id="Eanchor_2"></a><a href="#Enote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> We
may reasonably consider &aelig;sthetics a branch of psychology,
but the emotions arising from the recognition
of beauty vary only in degree and not in kind,
whether the beauty be seen in nature or art. Consequently
there can be no separate psychological en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>quiry
into the perception of beauty created by art
as distinguished from that observable in nature.</p>

<p>It must be a natural attraction for the insoluble
mysteries of life that has induced so many philosophers
during the last two centuries to put forward
&aelig;sthetic systems. That no two of these systems
agree on important points, and that each and every
one has crumbled to dust from a touch of the wand
of experience administered by a hundred hands, are
well-known facts, yet still the systems continue to
be calmly presented as if they were valuable contributions
to knowledge. Each new critic in the domain
of philosophy carefully and gravely sets them
up, and then carefully and gravely knocks them
down.<a name="Eanchor_3" id="Eanchor_3"></a><a href="#Enote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> An excuse for the systems has been here
and there offered, that the explanations thereof
sometimes include valuable philosophical comments
or suggestions. This may be, but students cannot
reasonably be expected to sift out a few oats from
a bushel of husks, even if the supply be from the bin
of a Hegel or a Schopenhauer. Is it too much to
suggest that these phantom systems be finally consigned
to the grave of oblivion which has yawned
for them so long and so conspicuously? Bubbles
have certain measurements and may brilliantly glow,
but they are still bubbles. It is as impossible to
build up a system of philosophy upon the perception
of beauty, which depends entirely upon physical
and physiological laws, as to erect a system of ethics
on the law of gravitation, for a feasible connection
between superstructure and foundation cannot be
presented to the mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>We may further note that a proper apprehension
of standards of judgment in art cannot be obtained
unless the separate and relative &aelig;sthetic values of
the two forms of beauty are considered, because
the beauty of a work may appear greater at one time
than at another, according as it is more or less permanent
or fleeting, that is to say, according as the
balance of the sensorial and intellectual elements
therein is more or less uneven; or if the beauty
present be almost entirely emotional, according as
the observer may be affected by independent sensorial
conditions of time or place. Consequent upon these
considerations, an endeavour has been made in this
work to distinguish between the two forms of beauty
in the various arts, and the separate grades thereof.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the writer has adopted the
somewhat unusual course of including fiction among
the fine arts. Why this practice is not commonly
followed is hard to determine, but no definition of a
fine art has been or can be given which does not
cover fiction. In the definition here accepted, the
art is clearly included, for the primary object of
fiction is the beautiful representation of nature for
the purpose of giving disinterested pleasure.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Art is independent of conditions of peoples or
countries. Its germ is unconnected with civilization,
politics, religion, laws, manners, or morals.
It may appear like a brilliant flower where the mind
of man is an intellectual desert, or refuse to bloom
in the busiest hive of human energy. Its mother
is the imagination, and wherever this has room to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
expand, there art will grow, though the ground may
be nearly sterile, and the bud wither away from want
of nourishment. Every child is born a potential
artist, for he comes into the world with sensorial
nerves, and a brain which directs the imagination.
The primitive peoples made beautiful things long
before they could read or write, and the recognition
of harmony of form appears to have been one of the
first understandings in life after the primal instincts
of self-preservation and the continuation of the
species. Some of the sketches made by the cave men
of France are equal to anything of the kind produced
in a thousand years of certain ancient civilizations,
commencing countless centuries after the
very existence of the cave men had been forgotten;
and even if executed now, would be recognized
as indicating the possession of considerable talent
by the artists. The greatest poem ever written
was given birth in a country near which barbaric
hordes had recently devastated populous cities, and
wrecked a national fabric with which were interwoven
centuries of art and culture. That the author
of this poem had seen great works of art is certain,
or he could not have conceived the shield of Achilles,
but the laboured sculpture that had fired his imagination,
and the legends which had perhaps been the
seed of his masterpieces were doubtless buried with
his own records beneath the tramp of numberless
mercenaries. Fortunately here and there the human
voice could draw from memory's store, and so the
magic of Homer was whispered by the dying to the
living; but even his time and place are now only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
vaguely known, and he remains like the waratah on
the bleached pasture of some desert fringe&mdash;a solitary
blaze of scarlet where all else is drear and
desolate.</p>

<p>Strong is the root of art, though frail the flower.
Stifled in sun-burnt ground ere it can welcome the
smile of light; fading with the first blast of air upon
its delicate shoots; shrivelling back to dust when
the buds are ready to break; or falling in the struggle
to spread its branches after its beautiful blossoms
have scattered their fragrance around: whatever
condition has brought it low, it ever fights again&mdash;ever
seeks to assure mankind that while it may
droop or disappear, its seed, its heart, its life, are
imperishable, and surely it will bloom again in all
its majesty. Sometimes with decades it has run a
fitful course; sometimes with centuries; sometimes
with millenniums. It has heralded every civilization,
but its breath is freedom, and it flourishes and sickens
only with liberty. Trace its course in the life
of every nation, and the track will be found parallel
with the line of freedom of thought. A solitary
plant may bloom unimpeded far from tyranny's
thrall, but the art and soul of a nation live, and throb,
and die, together.</p>

<p>Egypt, Babylon, Crete, Greece, Rome, tell their
stories through deathless monuments, and all are
alike in that they demonstrate the dependence of
art expansion upon freedom of action and opinion.
An art rises, develops another and another, and
they proceed together on their way. Sooner or
later comes catastrophe in the shape of crushing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>tyranny which curbs the mind with slavery, or steel-bound
sacerdotal rules which say to the artist
"Thou shalt go no further," or annihilation of nation
and life. What imagination can picture the expansion
of art throughout the world had its flight been
free since the dawn of history? Greece reached the
sublime because its mind was unfettered, but twenty
or thirty centuries before Phidias, Egyptian art had
arrived at a loftier plane than that on which the
highest plastic art of Greece was standing but
a few decades before the Olympian Zeus uplifted
the souls of men, while whole civilizations with
their arts had lived and died, and were practically
forgotten.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that while in its various isolated
developments, art has proceeded from the
immature to the mature, there has been no general
evolution, as in natural life, but on the other hand
there seems to be a limit to its progress. So far as
our imagination can divine, no higher reaches in art
are attainable than those already achieved. The
mind can conceive of nothing higher than the spiritual,
and this cannot be represented in art except by
means of form; while within the range of human
intelligence, no suggestion of spiritual form can rise
above the ideals of Phidias. Of the purely human
form, nothing greater than the work of Praxiteles
and Raphael can be pictured on our brains. There
may be poets who will rival Homer and Shakespeare,
but it is exceedingly doubtful. In any case we must
discard the law of evolution as applicable to the
arts, with the one exception of music, which, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
account of the special functioning of its signs, must
be put into a division by itself.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>But although there has been no general progression
in art parallel with the growth of the sciences
and civilization, there have been, as already indicated,
many separate epochs of art cultivation in
various countries, sometimes accompanied by the
production of immortal works, which epochs in
themselves seem to provide examples of restricted
evolution.<a name="Eanchor_4" id="Eanchor_4"></a><a href="#Enote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> It is desirable to refer to these art
periods, as they are commonly called, for the purpose
of removing, if possible, a not uncommon apprehension
that they are the result of special conditions
operating an &aelig;sthetic stimulus, and that similar or
related conditions must be present in any country if
the flame of art there is to burn high and brightly.<a name="Eanchor_5" id="Eanchor_5"></a><a href="#Enote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
The well-defined periods vary largely both in character
and duration, the most important of them&mdash;the
Grecian development and the Italian Renaissance&mdash;covering
two or three centuries each, and
the others, as the French thirteenth century sculpture
expansion, the English literary revival in the
sixteenth century,<a name="Eanchor_6" id="Eanchor_6"></a><a href="#Enote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and the Dutch development in
painting in the seventeenth, lasting only a few
decades. These latter periods can be dispensed
with at once because they were each concerned with
one art only, and therefore can scarcely have resulted
from a general &aelig;sthetic stimulus. But the
Grecian and Italian movements applied to all the
arts. They represented natural developments from
the crude to the advanced, of which all nations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>produce examples, and were only exceptional in that
they reached higher levels in art than were attained
by other movements. But there is no evidence to
show that they were brought about by special circumstances
outside of the arts themselves. While
there were national crises preceding the one development,
there was no trouble of consequence to
herald the other, nor was there any parallel between
the conditions of the two peoples during the progress
of the movements. A short reference to each development
will show that its rise and decline were
the outcome of simple matter-of-fact conditions of
a more or less accidental nature, uninfluenced by
an &aelig;sthetic impulse in the sense of inspiration.</p>

<p>The most common suggestion advanced to account
for the rise in Grecian art, is that it was due to the
exaltation of the Greek mind through the victories
of Marathon, Plat&aelig;a, and Salamis. That a people
should be so trampled upon as were the Greeks;
that their cities should be razed, their country desolated,
and their commerce destroyed; that notwithstanding
all this they should refuse to give way
before enemies outnumbering them twenty, fifty,
or even a hundred to one; and that after all they
should crush these enemies, was no doubt a great
and heroic triumph, likely to exalt the nation and
feed the imagination of the people for a long time
to come; but that these victories were responsible
for the lofty eminence reached by the Greek artists,
cannot be maintained. From what we know of
Calamis, Myron, and others, it is clear that Grecian
art was already on its way to the summit reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
by Phidias when Marathon and Salamis were fought,
though the victories of the Greek arms hastened the
development for the plain reason that they led to
an increased demand for works of art. And the
decline in Grecian art resulted purely and simply
from a lessened demand. Though this was the
reason for the general decay, there was a special
cause for the apparent weakening with the commencement
of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> In the fifth century
Phidias climbed as high in the accomplishment
of ideals as the imagination could soar. He reached
the summit of human endeavour. Necessarily then,
unless another Phidias arose, whatever in art came
after him would appear to mark a decline. But it
is scarcely proper to put the case of Phidias forward
for comparative purposes. He carried the art of
sculpture higher than it is possible for the painter
to ascend, and so we should rather use the giants of
the fourth century&mdash;Scopas, Praxiteles, Lysippus,
Apelles&mdash;as the standards to be compared with the
foremost spirits of the Italian Renaissance&mdash;Raphael
and Michelangelo&mdash;for each of these groups achieved
the human ideal, though failing with the spiritual
ideal established by Phidias.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that all good art means
slow work&mdash;long thinking, much experiment, tedious
attention to detail in plan, and careful execution.
Meanwhile men have to live, even immortal artists,
and rarely indeed does one undertake a work of
importance on his own account. It is true that in
the greater days of Greece the best artists were almost
entirely employed by a State, or at least to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
execute works for public exhibition, and doubtless
the payment they received was quite a secondary
matter with them, but nevertheless few could practise
their art without remuneration. During the fifth
and fourth centuries great events were constantly
happening in Greece, and in consequence there were
numberless temples to build and adorn, groves to
decorate, men to honour, and monumental tombs to
erect. Innumerable statues of gods and goddesses
were wanted, and we must not forget the wholesale
destruction of Athenian and other temples and
sculptures during the Persian invasion. In fact for
a century and a half after Plat&aelig;a, there was practically
an unlimited demand for works of art, and it
was only when the empire of Alexander began to
crumble away that conditions changed. While
Greece was weakening Rome was growing and her
lengthening shadows were approaching the walls of
Athens. Greece could build no more temples when
her people were becoming slaves of Rome; she could
order no more monuments when defeat was the
certain end of struggle. And so the decline was
brought about, not by want of artists, but through
the dearth of orders and the consequent neglect of
competition.</p>

<p>In the case of the Italian Renaissance the decadence
was not due to the same cause. The art of
Greece declined gradually in respect of quantity
as well as quality, while in Italy after the decay in
quality set in, art was as nourishing as ever from
the point of view of demand. The change in the
character of the art was due entirely to Raphael's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
achievements. As with the early Greek, nearly the
whole of the early Italian art was concerned with
religion, though in this case there were very few
ideals. The numerous ancient gods of Greece and
Rome were long gone, to become only classical heroes
with the Italians, and their places were taken by
twenty or thirty personages from the New Testament.
Incidents from the Old Testament were
sometimes painted, but nearly all the greater work
dealt with the life of Christ and the Saints. The
painters of the first century of the Renaissance distributed
their attention fairly equally among these
personages, but as time went on and the art became
of a superior order, artists aimed at the highest development
of beauty that their imaginations could
conceive, and hence the severe beauty that might
be shown in a picture of Christ or a prominent Saint,
had commonly to give way to a more earthly perfection
of feature and form, which, suggesting an
ideal, could only be given to the figure of the Virgin.
And so the test of the power of an artist came to be
instinctively decided by his representation of the
Madonna. No doubt there were many persons
living in the fifteenth century who watched the
gradually increasing beauty of the Madonna as
depicted by the succession of great painters then
working, and wondered when and where the summit
would be reached&mdash;when an artist would appear
beyond whose work the imagination could not pass,
for there is a limit to human powers.</p>

<p>The genius arose in Raphael, and when he produced
in the last ten or twelve years of his life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Madonna after Madonna, so far in advance of anything
that had hitherto been done, so great in beauty
as to leave his fellow artists lost in wonder, so lofty
in conception that the term "divine" was applied
to him in his lifetime, it was inevitable that a decadence
should set in, for so far as the intelligence
could see, whatever came after him must be inferior.
He did not ascend to the height of Phidias, for a
pure ideal of spiritual form is beyond the power of
the painter,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> but as with Praxiteles he reached a
perfect human ideal, and so gained the supreme
pinnacle of his art. But while there was an inevitable
decadence after him, as after Praxiteles, it was,
as already indicated, only in the character of the
art, for in Italy artists generally were as busy for
a hundred years after Raphael, as during his time.
Michelangelo, Titian, and the other giants who were
working when Raphael died, kept up the renown of
the period for half a century or so, but it seemed impossible
for artists who came on the scene after
Raphael's death, to enter upon an entirely original
course. The whole of the new generation seemed
to cling to the models put forward by the great
Urbino painter, save some of the Venetians who had
a model of their own in Titian.</p>

<p>Thus it is clear that the rise and decline of the
Grecian and Italian movements were due to well
ascertained causes which had nothing to do with a
national &aelig;sthetic impulse; nor is there evidence of
such an impulse connected with other art developments.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>The suggestion that a nation may be assisted in
its art by emotional or psychological influences
arising from patriotic exaltation, is only an extension
of an opinion commonly held, that the individual
artist is subject to similar influences, though
due to personal exaltation connected with his art.
It is as well to point out that there is only one way
to produce a work of art, and that is to combine the
exercise of the imagination with skill in execution.
The artist conceives an idea and puts it into form.
He does nothing more. He can rely upon no extraneous
influence. It is suggested that to bring about
a supreme accomplishment in art, the imagination
must be associated with something outside of our
power of control&mdash;some impulse which acts upon
the brain but is independent of it. This unmeasured
force or lever is usually known by the term "Inspiration."
It is supposed that this force comes to certain
persons when they have particular moods upon
them, and gives them a great idea which they may
use in a painting, a poem, or a musical composition.
The suggestion is attractive, but in the long range
of historical record there is no evidence that accident,
in the shape of inspiration or other psychological
lever, has been responsible in the slightest
degree for the production of a work of art. The
writer of a sublime poem, or the painter of a perfect
Madonna, uses the same kind of mental and material
labour as the man who chisels a lion's head on a
chair, or adds a filigree ornament to a bangle. The
difference is one of degree only. The poet or painter
is gifted with a vivid imagination which he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
cultivated by study; and by diligence has acquired
superlative facility in execution, which he uses to
the best advantage. The work of the furniture
carver or jeweller does not require such high powers,
and he climbs only a few steps of the ladder whose
uppermost rungs have been scaled by the greater
artists.</p>

<p>If in the course of the five and twenty centuries
during which works of high art have been produced,
some of them had been executed with the assistance
of a psychological impulse directed independently
of the will, there would certainly have been references
to the phenomenon by the artists concerned,
or the very numerous art historians, but without a
known exception, all the great artists who have left
any record of the cause of their success, or whose
views on the subject are to be gained by indirect
references, have attributed this success to hard
study, or manual industry, or both together. We
know little of the opinion of the ancient Greeks on
the matter, but the few anecdotes we have, indicate
that their artists were very practical men indeed,
and hardly likely to expect mysterious psychological
influences to help them in their work. So with the
Romans, and it is noticeable that the key to the
production of beauty in poetry, in the opinion of
Virgil and Horace, is careful preparation and unlimited
revision. This appears to be the view of
some modern poets, and if Dante, Shakespeare, and
Milton, had experienced visionary inspiration, we
should surely have heard of it. Fortunately some
of the most eminent painters of modern times have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
expressed themselves definitely upon the point.
Lionardo observed that the painter arrives at perfection
by manual operation; and Michelangelo
asserted that Raphael acquired his excellence by
study and application. Rubens praised his brushes,
by which he meant his acquired facility, as the
instruments of his fortune; and Nicholas Poussin
attributed his success to the fact that he neglected
nothing, referring of course to his studies. According
to his biographers, the triumphs of Claude were
due to his untiring industry, while Reynolds held
that nothing is denied to well directed labour. And
so with many others down to Turner, whose secret
according to Ruskin, was sincerity and toil.</p>

<p>It would seem to be possible for an artist to work
himself into a condition of emotional excitement,<a name="Eanchor_7" id="Eanchor_7"></a><a href="#Enote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
either involuntarily when a great thought comes to
him, or voluntarily when he seeks ideas wherewith
to execute a brilliant conception; and it is comprehensible
that when in this condition, which is practically
an extreme concentration of his mental energy
upon the purpose in hand, images or other &aelig;sthetic
suggestions suitable for his work may present themselves
to his mind. These he might regard as the
result of inspiration, but in reality they would be
the product of a trained imagination operating
under advantageous conditions.</p>

<p>Nor can any rule be laid down that the character
or temperament of an artist influences his work, for
if instances can be given in support of such an assertion,
at least an equal number may be adduced
which directly oppose it. If we might approximately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
gauge the true characters of Fra Angelico and Michelangelo
from a study of their work, it is certain that
no imagination could conjure up the actual personalities
of Perugino and Cellini, from an examination
of the paintings of the one and the sculptures of the
other. What can be said on the subject when assassins
of the nature of Corenzio and Caravaggio
painted so many beautiful things, and evil-minded
men like Ribera and Battistello adorned great
churches with sacred compositions? If the work
of Claude appears to harmonize with his character,
that of Turner does not. "Friendless in youth:
loveless in manhood; hopeless in death." Such
was Turner according to Ruskin, but is there any
sign of this in his works? Not a trace. If any
conclusion as to his character and temperament
can be drawn from Turner's paintings, it is that he
was a gay, light-hearted thinker, with all the optimism
and high spirits that come from a delight in
beautiful things. The element of mood is unquestionably
of importance in the work of an artist, but
it is not uncommon to find the character of his
designs contrary to his mood. Poets, as in the case
of Hood, or painters as with Tassaert, may execute
the most lively pieces while in moods verging on
despair. With some men adversity quickens the
imagination with fancies; with others it benumbs
their faculties.</p>

<p>The tendency of popular criticism to search for
psychological phenomena in paintings, apparently
arises largely from the difficulty in comprehending
how it is that certain artists of high repute vary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
their styles of painting after many years of good
work, and produce pictures without the striking
beauty characterizing their former efforts. Sometimes
when age is beginning to tell upon them, they
broaden their manner considerably, as with Rembrandt
and others of the seventeenth century, and
many recent artists of lesser fame. The critic, very
naturally perhaps, is chary of condemning work
from the hand of one who has given evidence of
consummate skill, and so seeks for hidden beauties
in lieu of those to which he has been accustomed.
A simple enquiry into the matter will show that
the change of style in these cases has a commonplace
natural cause.</p>

<p>To be in the front rank an artist must have acquired
a vast knowledge of the technique of his art,
and have a powerful imagination which has been
highly cultivated. But the qualifications must be
balanced. Commonly when this balance is not
present the deficiency is in the imagination, but
there are instances where, though the power of execution
is supreme, the imagination has so far exceeded
all bounds as to render this power of comparatively
small practical value. The most conspicuous example
of this want of balance is Lionardo, who accomplished
little though he was scarcely surpassed
in execution by Raphael or Michelangelo. His
imagination invariably ran beyond his execution;
his ideas were always above the works he completed
or partly finished: he saw in fact far beyond anything
he could accomplish, and so was never satisfied
with the result of his labour. At the same time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
he was filled with ideas in the sciences, and investigated
every branch of knowledge without bringing
his conclusions to fruition. During the latter part
of his life, Michelangelo showed a similar defect
in a lesser degree, for his unfinished works of the
period exceed in number those he completed. Naturally
such intellectual giants, whose imaginations
cannot be levelled with the highest ability in execution,
are few, but the lesser luminaries who fail, or
who constantly fail, in carrying out their conceptions,
are legion, though they may have absorbed
the limit of knowledge which they are capable of
acquiring in respect of execution. It is common
for a painter to turn out a few masterpieces and
nothing else of permanent value. This was the
case with numerous Italian artists of the seventeenth
century, and it is indeed a question whether there
is one of them, except perhaps Domenichino, whose
works have not a considerable range in &aelig;sthetic
value.</p>

<p>There have been still more artists whose powers
of execution were far beyond the flights of their
imaginations. They include the whole of the seventeenth
century Dutch school with Rembrandt at
their head, and the whole of the Spanish school of
the same period, except El Greco, Zurbaran, and
Murillo. When an artist is in the first rank in respect
of execution, but is distinctly inferior in imaginative
scope, his work in all grades of his art, except the
highest, where ideals are possible, seems to have a
greater value than it really possesses because we
are insensibly cognizant that the accomplishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
rises above the idea upon which it is founded. On
the other hand his work in the highest plane appears
to possess a lower value, because we are surprised that
ideals have not been attempted, and that the types
of the spiritual and classical personages represented
are of the same class of men and women as those
exhibited in works dealing with ordinary human
occupations or actions. This is why the sacred and
classical pictures of Rembrandt, Vermeer of Delft,
and the other leading Dutch artists, appear to be
below their portrait and genre work in power.</p>

<p>The course of variation in the work of a great
painter follows the relative power of his imagination
and his execution. Where there is a fair balance
between the two, the work of the artist increases in
&aelig;sthetic value with his age and experience; but
when his facility in execution rises above the force
of his imagination, then his middle period is invariably
the best, his later work showing a gradual
depreciation in quality. The reason is obvious.
The surety of the hand and eye diminishes more
rapidly than the power of the mind, which in fact
is commonly enhanced with experience till old age
comes on. Great artists who rely mostly upon their
powers of execution, and exhibit limited fertility in
invention, such as Rembrandt, have often a manner
which is so interwoven with the effects they seek,
that they are seldom or never able to avail themselves
of the assistance of others in the lesser important
parts of their work. A man with the fertile
mind of a Rubens may gather around him a troupe
of artists nearly as good as himself in execution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
who will carry out his designs completely save for
certain details. Thus he is not occupied with
laborious toil, and the decreasing accuracy of his
handiwork troubles him but little. On the other
hand a Rembrandt, whose merits lie chiefly in the
delicate manipulation of light effects and intricate
shades in expression, remains tied to his canvas.
He feels intensely the decreasing facility in the use
of his brush which necessarily accompanies his advancing
years, and his only recourse from a stoppage
of work is an alteration in manner involving a reduction
of labour and a lessened strain upon the eyesight.
With few exceptions the great masterpieces
of Rembrandt were produced in his middle period.
During the last ten or fifteen years of his life he
gradually increased his breadth of manner. He was
still magnificent in general expression, but the intimate
details which produced such glorious effects
in the great Amsterdam picture, and fifty or more of
his single portraits, could not be obtained with hog's
hair.<a name="Eanchor_8" id="Eanchor_8"></a><a href="#Enote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Disconnecting then the work of the artist with
inspiration or other psychological force, we may
now enquire what is mean by "Genius," "Natural
gift," or other term used to explain the power of
an artist to produce a great work? It would appear
that the answer is closely concerned with the
condition of the sensorial nerves at birth, and the
precocity or otherwise of the infantile imagination.
From the fact that we can cultivate the eye and ear
so as to recognize forms of harmony which we could
not before perceive, and seeing that the effect of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
this cultivation is permanent, it follows that exercise
must bring about direct changes in the nerves associated
with these organs, attuning them so to speak,
and enabling them to respond to newer harmonies
arising from increased complexity of the signs used.<a name="Eanchor_9" id="Eanchor_9"></a><a href="#Enote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
It is matter of common knowledge that the structure
of the sensorial nerves varies largely in different
persons at birth, and when a boy at a very early
age shows precocious ability in music or drawing,
we may properly infer that the condition of his
optic or aural nerves is comparatively advanced,
that is to say, it is much less rudimentary than that
of the average person at the same age; in other
words accident has given him a nerve regularity
which can only be gained by the average boy after
long exercise. The precocious youth has not a
nerve structure superior in kind, but it is abnormally
developed, and so he is ahead of his confreres
in the matter of time, for under equal conditions of
study he is sooner able to arrive at a given degree
of skill.</p>

<p>But early appreciation of complex harmony, and
skill in execution, are not enough to produce a great
artist, for there must be associated with these things
a powerful imagination. While the particular nerves
or vessels of the brain with which the imagination
is concerned have not been identified, we know by
analogy and experience that the exercise of the
imagination like that of any other function, is necessary
for its development, and according as we allow
it to remain in abeyance so we reduce its active
value. Clearly also, the seat of the imagination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
at birth is less rudimentary in some persons than
in others. From these facts it would appear that
when both the sensory nerve structure and the seat
of the imagination are advanced at birth, then we
have the basis upon which the precocious genius is
built up. With such conditions, patient toil and
deep study are alone necessary to produce a sublime
artist. Evidently it is extremely rare for the imagination
and nerve structure to be together so advanced
naturally, but commonly one is more than
rudimentary, and the deficiency in the other is
compensated for by study.<a name="Eanchor_10" id="Eanchor_10"></a><a href="#Enote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Of course these observations are general, for there
arises the question, to what extent can the senses
and imagination be trained? We may well conceive
that there is a limit to the development of the sense
organs. There must come a period when the optic
or aural nerves can be attuned no further; and is the
limit equal in all persons? The probability is that
it is not. The physical character of the nerves
almost certainly varies in different persons, some
being able to appreciate more complex harmonies
than others, granted the limit of development. This
is a point which has to be considered, particularly
in the case of music wherein as a rule, the higher
the beauty the more complex the combinations of
signs. There is a parallel problem to solve in respect
of the imagination. We can well believe that there
was something abnormal in the imagination of
Shakespeare, beyond the probability that in his
case the physiological system controlling the seat
of the imagination was unusually advanced at birth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
It is quite certain that with such a man a given
training would result in a far greater advance in the
functioning capacity of the imagination, than in
the vast majority of persons who might commence
the training on apparently equal terms; and he would
be able to go further&mdash;to surpass the point which
might be the limit of development with most
persons.</p>

<p>These questions are of the highest importance,
but they cannot be determined. We are acquainted
with certain facts relating to the general development
of the sense organs, and of the imagination;
and in regard to the former we know that there is
a limit within comprehensible bounds, but we see
only very dimly anything finite in the scope of the
imagination. With what other term than "limitless"
can we describe the imagination of a Shakespeare?
But in all cases, whatever the natural conditions
at birth, it is clear that hard work is the key
to success in art, and though some must work harder
than others to arrive at an equal result, it is satisfactory
to know that generally Carlyle was right
when he described "genius" as the transcendent
capacity for taking trouble, and we are not surprised
that Cicero should have come to the conclusion that
diligence is a virtue that seems to include all the
others.</p>

<p>Seeing that the conclusions above defined (and
some to be later drawn), are not entirely in accord
with a large part of modern criticism based upon
what are commonly described as new and improved
forms of the painter's art, it is necessary to refer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to these forms, which are generally comprehended
under what is known as Impressionism.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Alas, to
the frailty of man must we ascribe the spread of
this movement, which has destroyed so many bright
young intellects, and is at this moment leading
thousands of gentle spirits along the level path which
ends in despair. For the real road of art is steep,
and difficult, and long. Year upon year of patient
thought, patient observation, and patient toil, lie
ahead of every man who covets a crown of success
as a painter. He must seek to accumulate vast
stores of knowledge of the human form and its anatomy,
of nature in her prolific variety, of linear and
aerial perspective, of animals which move on land
or through the air, of the laws of colours and their
combinations. He must sound the depths of poetry,
and sculpture, and architecture; absorb the cream
of sacred and profane history; and with all these
things and many more, he must saturate his mind
with the practical details of his art. Every artist
whose work the world has learned to admire has
done his best to gain this knowledge, and certainly
no great design was ever produced by one whose
youth and early manhood were not worn with ardent
study. For knowledge and experience are the only
foundations upon which the imagination can build.
Every new conception is a rearrangement of known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>signs, and the imagination is powerless to arrange
them appropriately without a thorough comprehension
of their character and significance.</p>


<p>This then is the programme of work which must
be adopted by any serious aspirant to fame in the
art of the painter, and it is perhaps not surprising
that the number of artists who survive the ordeal
is strictly limited. In any walk of life where years
of struggle are necessary for success, how small the
proportion of men who persevere to the end; who
present a steel wall to misfortune and despair, and
with an indomitable will, overcome care, and worry,
and fatigue, for year after year, till at last the clouds
disappear, and they are able to front the world with
an all-powerful shield of radiant knowledge! But
unfortunately in the painter's art it is difficult to
convince students of the necessity for long and
hard study, because there is no definite standard
for measuring success or failure which they can
grasp without long experience. In industries where
knowledge is applied to improvement in appliances,
or methods with definite ends, or to the realization
of projects having a fixed scope, failure is determined
by material results measured commonly by mathematical
processes of one kind or another. A man
produces a new alloy which he claims will fulfil a
certain purpose. It is tested by recognized means:
all concerned admit the validity of the test, and there
the matter ends. But in the arts, while the relative
value of the respective grades is equally capable of
demonstration, the test is of a different kind. Instead
of weights and measures which every man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
can apply, general experience must be brought in.
The individual may be right in his judgment, and
commonly is, but he is unable to measure the evidence
of his senses by material demonstration, and
as he has no means of judging whether his senses
are normal, except by comparison, he is liable to
doubt his own experience if it clash with that of
others. Thus, he may find but little beauty in a
given picture, and then may read or hear that the
work has a high &aelig;sthetic value, and without calling
to mind the fact that no evidence in the matter is
conclusive unless it be based on general experience,
he is liable to believe that his own perception is in
some way deficient.</p>

<p>Thus in the arts, and particularly in painting,
there is ample scope for the spread of false principles.
Poetry has an advantage in that the intellect must
first be exercised before the simplest pictures are
thrown on the brain, so feeble or eccentric verse appeals
to very few persons, and seldom has a client&egrave;le,
if one may use the word, outside of small coteries
of weak thinkers. It is difficult also in sculpture
to put forward poor works as of a high order, because
this art deals almost entirely with simple
human and animal forms in respect of which the
knowledge is universal, and so as signs they cannot
be varied except in the production of what would
be immediately recognized as monstrosities. But
in painting an immense variety in kind of beauty
may be produced, from a simple colour harmony
to the representation of ideal forms involving the
highest sensorial and intellectual reaches, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
is ample scope for the misrepresentation of &aelig;sthetic
effects&mdash;for the suggestion that a work yielding a
momentary appeal to the senses is superior to a
high form of permanent beauty.</p>

<p>It is to the ease with which simple forms of ephemeral
beauty may be produced in painting that is
due the large number of artists who should never
have entered upon the profession. Nearly every
person of average intelligence is capable with a few
lessons of producing excellent imitations of natural
things in colour, as for instance, flowers, bits of
landscape, and so on, and great numbers of young
men and women, surprised at the facility with which
this work can be done, erroneously suppose that
nature has endowed them with special gifts, and so
take up the art of painting as a career. Hence for
every sculptor there are twenty painters. Now
these youthful aspirants usually start with determination
and hope, but although they know the
value of studious toil, they rarely comprehend that
this toil, long continued, is the only key to success.
Most of them seem under the impression that inspiration
will come to their assistance, and that
their genius will enable them to dispense with much
of the labour which others, less fortunate, must
undertake. They do not understand that all painters,
even a Raphael, must go through long years of
hard application.</p>

<p>We need not be surprised that there should be
occasional eruptions in art circles tending to the
exaltation of the immature at the expense of the
superior, or even the sublime, for we have always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
with us the undiligent man of talent, and the "unrecognized
genius." But hitherto, movements of
the kind have not been serious, for with one exception
they are lost in oblivion, and the exception is
little more than a vague memory. That the present
movement should have lasted so long is not difficult
to understand when we remember the modern advantages
for the spread of new sensations&mdash;the
exhibitions, the unlimited advertising scope, and
above all the new criticism, with its extended vocabulary,
its original philosophy, and its boundless
discoveries as to the psychological and musical
qualities of paint. That history is silent as to previous
eruptions of the kind before the seventeenth
century is a matter of regret. It is unlikely that
the greatest of all art epochs experienced an impressionist
fever, for one cannot imagine the spread of
spurious principles within measurable distance of a
State (Thebes) which went so far as to prohibit the
representation of unbeautiful things. In respect of
poetry we know that the Greeks stood no nonsense,
for did not Zoilus suffer an ignominious death for
venturing upon childish criticism of Homer? In
Rome eccentric painters certainly found some means
to thrive, for where "Bohemian" poets gathered,
who neglected the barber and the bath, and pretended
an &aelig;sthetic exclusiveness, there surely would
painters of "isms" be found in variety. Naturally
in the early stages of the Renaissance, when patronage
of the arts was almost confined to the Church,
and so went hand in hand with learning, inferior
art stood small chance of recognition; and a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
later when Lorenzo gathered around him the intellectual
cream of Italy; when the pupils of Donatello
were spreading the light of his genius; when the
patrician beauties of Florence were posing for Ghirlandaio
and his brilliant confr&egrave;res, and when the
minds of Lionardo and Michelangelo were blooming;
who would have dared to talk of the psychological
qualities of paint, or suggest the composition of a
fresco "symphony"?</p>

<p>But another century and more passed away. The
blaze of the Renaissance had gone down, but the embers
were kept alive, for Italy still seemed to vibrate
with a desire to paint. Simultaneously in Flanders,
in Holland, in France, and in England, private
citizens appeared to develop a sudden demand for
pictures, and quite naturally artists multiplied and
fed the flame. Outside of Italy the hustle and bustle
in the art world were novelties to the general public,
though pleasant ones withal, and for half a century
or more they delighted in the majestic designs of
Rubens and Van Dyck, the intimate scenes of the
Dutch artists, and the delicate landscapes of Claude
and Poussin and their followers, which were continually
finding their way from Rome. The simplicity
of the people protected the arts. They knew the
hard labour involved in the production of a picture;
the worries, the struggles, the joys of the painters;
and daily saw beautiful imitations of every-day life
in the shops and markets. They must have been
proud of them&mdash;insensibly proud of the value of
human endeavour. For them the sham and immature
had no place: there is not a single example of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>spurious art of the first three quarters of the seventeenth
century that has come down to us from Holland
or Flanders. But while the Dutch school was
at the height of its fame, a change was marking
Italian art conditions. The half score of academies
scattered through the country were still in a state
of activity, carrying on, as far as they could, the
traditions of the Renaissance: from all parts of
Europe students were still pouring in, endeavouring
to glean the secrets of the immortals; and there was
no apparent decrease in the demand for pictures
from the religious foundations and private buyers.
But the character of the art produced was rapidly
declining: the writing on the wall was being done
by the hand that wielded the brush. As a necessary
consequence the trader was called in and art began
to be commercialized. Worse still, fashions appeared,
guided by successive masters in the various
centres, often with an influence quite out of proportion
with their merits.</p>

<p>By the middle of the century a general fall in
activity and enthusiasm was noticeable. The disciples
of the Roman school, largely through the
pernicious influence of Bernini, had nearly forgotten
the great lessons taught by the followers of Raphael,
and later by the three Carracci, and were fast descending
below mediocrity; the Florentine school included
half a dozen good painters, mostly students
of Berritini: Venice was falling into a stagnation
in which she remained till the appearance of Longhi
and Tiepolo and their brethren; Bologna was living
on the reputation of the Carracci, and had yet to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
recover with the aid of Cignani: Milan and Genoa
as separate schools had practically faded away;
and the Neapolitan school was relying on Salvator
Rosa, though Luca Giordano was growing into an
inexhaustible hive of invention. This was the condition
of Italian art, while political and other troubles
were further complicating the position of artists.
For most of them the time was gloomy and the future
dark. A few turned to landscape; others extended
the practice of copying the early masters for the
benefit of foreign capitals, while some sought for
novelty in still-life, or in the then newly practised
pastel work. But there was a considerable number
who would have none of these things; some of them
with talent but lacking industry, and others with
industry but void of imagination. What were these
to do at a time when at the best the outlook was
poor?</p>

<p>An answer came to this question. A new taste
must be cultivated, and for an art that required less
study and trouble to produce than the sublime forms
with which the Renaissance culminated. So whispers
went round that Raphael was not really so great
a master as was supposed, and that with Michelangelo
he was out of date and did not comprehend
the real meaning of art&mdash;very similar conclusions
with which the modern impressionist movement was
heralded.<a name="Eanchor_11" id="Eanchor_11"></a><a href="#Enote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The discovery was made in Rome, but
the news expanded to Florence and Naples, and
Venice, and behold the result&mdash;Sprezzatura, or to
use the modern word, Impressionism, that is to say,
the substitution of sketches for finished pictures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
though this is not the definition usually given to it.
But fortunately for the art of the time the innovation
was chiefly confined to coteries. All that could
be said or done failed to convince the principal
patrons of the period that a half finished work is
so beautiful as a completed one, and so the novelties
rarely found entrance into great collections, nor were
they used to adorn the interiors of public buildings.
But a good many of them were executed though
they have long ceased to interest anybody. Now
and again one comes across an example in a sleepy
Italian village, or in the smaller shops of Rome or
Florence, but it is quickly put aside as a melancholy
memento of a disordered period of art when talented
painters had to struggle for fame, and the untalented
for bread.</p>

<p>The cult of Sprezzatura faded to a glimmer before
the end of the seventeenth century. Bernini was
dead, and Carlo Maratta with a few others led the
way in re-establishing the health if not the brilliancy
and renown of Italian art. Nor did a recurrence of
the movement occur in the next century. During
this period there was comparatively little call for
art in Italy, and at the end of it, when political
disturbances made havoc with academies and artists,
the principal occupation of Italian painters with
talent was precisely that of their skilled brethren in
Holland and Flanders&mdash;the manufacture of "old"
masterpieces. It was reserved for the second half
of the nineteenth century for Sprezzatura to make
its reappearance, and this time Italy followed the
lead of France.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many methods and mannerisms which
go under the name of Impressionism, but they are
mostly suggestions in design or experiments in tones
which were formerly produced solely as studies to
assist artists in executing their complete works, or
else eccentricities which are obviously mere camouflage
for lack of skill.<a name="Eanchor_12" id="Eanchor_12"></a><a href="#Enote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Sometimes the sketches
are slightly amplified with more or less finished signs,
and now and then novelties are present in the shape
of startling colour effects; but in all cases the
impartial observer sees in the pictures only sensorial
beauty of a kind which is inevitably short lived,
while his understanding is oppressed with the thought,
firstly that the picture is probably the result of a
want of diligence on the part of the artist, and
secondly that its exhibition as a serious work is
somewhat of a reflection upon the intelligence of the
public.</p>

<p>Obviously the fundamental basis of Impressionism
is weak and illogical, for in our conception of
nature it invites us to eliminate the understanding.
What the impressionist practically says is: "We
do not see solid form; we see only flat surface in
which objects are distinguished by colours. The
artist should reproduce these colours irrespective
of the nature of the objects." But the objects are
distinguished by our knowledge and experience,
and if we are to eliminate these in one art, why not
in another? Why trouble about carving in the
round when we only actually see in the human figure
a flat surface defined by colour? There is no scene
in nature such as the impressionist paints, nor can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
such a scene be thrown upon the mind of the painter
as a natural scene. Except in absolute deserts there
are no scenes without many signs which are clearly
defined to the eye, and which the artist can paint.
He cannot of course produce all the signs in a view,
but he can indicate sufficient of them to make a
beautiful picture apart from the tones, and there
can be no valid &aelig;sthetic reason for substituting for
these signs vague suggestions of colour infinitely
less definite than the signs as they appear in nature.
Nor is there any such atmosphere in nature as the
impressionist usually paints. We do not see blotched
outlines of human figures, but the outlines in nature,
except at a considerable distance, appear to us clear
and decisive though delicately shaded, and not as
seen through a veil of steam. Nor has any valid
reason been advanced for juxtaposing pure colours
instead of blending them before use.<a name="Eanchor_13" id="Eanchor_13"></a><a href="#Enote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Why should
the eye have to seek a particular distance from a
painting in order that the colours might naturally
blend, when the artist can himself blend them and
present a harmony which is observable at any reasonable
distance? We do not carve a statue with
blurred and broken edges, and then tell the observer
that the outlines will appear correct if he travel a
certain distance away before examining them.</p>

<p>In giving nearly his whole attention to colour the
impressionist limits his art to the feeblest form, and
produces a quickly tiring, ephemeral thing, as if
unconscious of natural beauty. Sylvan glades and
fairy dales, where the brooks ripple pleasantly as
they moisten the roots of the violet, and gently lave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the feet of the lark and the robin; where shady
trees bow welcome to the wanderer; where the
grassy carpet is sprinkled with flowers, and every
bush can tell of lovers' sighs! Does the impressionist
see these things? Offer him the sweetest beauties
of nature, and he shows you in return a shake of a
kaleidoscope. Mountain peaks towering one above
the other till their snowy crests sparkle the azure
sky; mighty rivers dividing the hills, crumbling the
granite cliffs, or thundering their course over impeding
rocks; cascades of flowing crystal falling into
seething seas of foam and mist; the angry ocean
convulsively defying human power with its heaving
walls and fearsome caverns! Nature in her grandest
form: sublime forces which kindle the spirit of man:
exhibit them to the impressionist, and he presents
to you a flat experiment in the juxtaposition of pure
colours! And the majesty of the human form, with
its glorious attributes; the noble woman and courageous
man; incidents of self-sacrifice; the realms of
spiritual beauty, and the great ideals which expand
the mind to the bounds of space and lift the soul to
Heaven! What of these? Ask the impressionist,
and he knows nothing of them. For his pencil they
are but relics of the past, like the bones of the men
who immortalized them in art.</p>

<p>This is perhaps an overstatement of impressionism
as applied to the works of a large number of
artists, who although commonly sacrificing form to
colour, infuse more or less interest in the human poses
and actions which are nominally the subjects of
their pictures. But one can only deal generally with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
such a matter. The evil of Impressionism does not
lie in the presentation of colour harmonies as beautiful
things, for they are unquestionably pleasing,
though the beauty is purely sensorial and of an
ephemeral character. The mischief arises from the
declaration, overt or implied, that these harmonies
represent the higher reaches of the painter's art,
and that form or design therein is of secondary
importance. Let something false in thought or
activity be propagated in any domain where the
trader can make use of it, then surely will the evil
grow, each new weed being more rank than its predecessor.
Impressionism is not a spurious form of
art, but seeing that its spurious claims were widely
accepted, with substantial results, there soon appeared
innumerable other forms inferior to it. There
is no necessity to deal here with these forms, with
the crude experiments of C&eacute;zanne, the vagaries of
Van Gogh,<a name="Eanchor_14" id="Eanchor_14"></a><a href="#Enote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the puerilities of Matisse, or the awful
sequence of "isms," commencing with "Post-Impressionism,"
and ending in the lowest depths of
art degradation; but it is proper to point out that
so long as Impressionism puts forward its extravagant
pretensions, these corrupt forms will continue
to taint the realm of art to the detriment of both
artists and public.</p>

<p>The significance of Impressionism is alleged by
its advocates to be of such considerable import that
in the public interest they should have brought
forward the most cogent arguments for its support.
But we have no such arguments, nor has any logical
reason been advanced to offset the obvious practical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
defects of the innovation, namely, that in the general
opinion the art is incomplete and decidedly inferior,
and that the leading critics of every country have
ignored or directly condemned it as an immature
form of art. Nevertheless, although there has
been no determined attempt to upset the basis of
art criticism as this basis has been understood for
more than twenty centuries; although the whole of
the arguments in support of the various forms of
Impressionism have failed to indicate any comprehensible
basis at all, but have dealt entirely with
vague sensorial theories, and psychological suggestions
which have no general meaning; although it
has never been remotely advanced that the beauty
produced by means of Impressionism is connected
with intellectual activity, as any high form of art
must necessarily be: notwithstanding all this, there
has been gradually growing up in the public mind,
a vague and uncertain signification of the comparative
forms of art, which tends to the general confusion
of thought amongst the public, and a chaos of
ideas in the minds of young artists.</p>

<p>The root of these spreading branches of mysticism
is to be found in the insistent affirmation that the
broad manner of painting is necessary for the production
of great work, and that only those old masters
who used this manner are worthy of study. It is,
as if the advocates of the new departure declare,
"If we cannot demonstrate the superiority of our
work, we can at least affirm that our methods are
the best." Where a small minority is persistent in
advocating certain views, and the great majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
do not trouble about replying thereto, false principles
are likely to find considerable area for permeation
among the rising generation, who are easily impressed
with the appearance of undisputed authority. In
the matter we are discussing, the limited authority
is particularly likely to be recognized by the inexperienced
of those mostly concerned, that is to say,
young artists, because it sanctions a method of work
which reduces to a minimum the labour involved
in arriving at excellence by the regular channels.</p>

<p>Now the artist is at liberty to use any method of
painting in producing his picture providing he presents
something beautiful. There is no special virtue
in a broad manner, a fine manner, or any other
manner, and the public, for whom the artist toils, is
not concerned with the point. It is as indifferent
to the kind of brushwork used by the painter, as to
the variety of chisel handled by the sculptor. The
observer of the picture judges it for its beauty, and
if it be well painted, then the character of the brushwork
is unconsidered. If, however, the brushwork
is so broad that the manner of painting protrudes
itself upon the observer at first sight, then the work
cannot be of a high class. All the paintings which
we recognize as great works of art are pictured upon
the brain as complete things immediately they are
brought within the compass of the eye, and to this
rule there is no exception. If, when encompassed
by the sight we find that a picture is so broadly
painted that we must move backwards to an unknown
point before the character of the work can be thoroughly
comprehended as a complete whole, then it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
is distinctly inferior as a work of art, because, being
incomprehensible on first inspection, it is necessarily
unbeautiful, and the act of converting it into a thing
of beauty, by means of a mechanical operation,
complicates the picture on the brain and so weakens
its &aelig;sthetic value.<a name="Eanchor_15" id="Eanchor_15"></a><a href="#Enote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> This is axiomatic. There
are proportions and propriety in all the arts, and
the good artist is quite aware of the lines to be
drawn in respect of the manner he adopts. Jan
Van Eyck's picture of Arnolfini and his Wife,
and Holbein's Ambassadors, both painted in the
fine manner, are equally great works of art with
Titian's portraits; and Raphael's portrait of Julius
II. (the Pitti Palace example),<a name="Eanchor_16" id="Eanchor_16"></a><a href="#Enote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> which is in a manner
midway between that of Holbein and Titian, is
superior to the work of all other portrait artists.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable outcome of the spread
of Impressionism is not the extravagant use of the
broad manner, for vagaries of this sort will always
find support among immature minds and undiligent
hands, but the establishment of a species of cult
connected with certain old masters who are not in
the very first rank, and the attempted relegation to
the background of public opinion, of the few sublime
painters whose colossal genius and superiority are
recognized by well balanced minds wherever the
breath of man can open the door of his soul. It is
unnecessary to enter upon a long enquiry as to the
validity of these proceedings, but the new position
in which two great masters have been placed can
scarcely be ignored. These masters are Rembrandt
and Velasquez, who appear to have been set upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the loftiest of pedestals in order that some of their
glory may be shed upon the new varieties of Sprezzatura.
It has been frequently said that these masters
were the first of impressionists, but the connection
between their work and Impressionism is hard to
find.<a name="Eanchor_17" id="Eanchor_17"></a><a href="#Enote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Not only is Rembrandt entirely distinct
in his manner from Velasquez; not only were they
both portrait painters primarily, while the great
bulk of impressionist work is landscape; but their
aims, their ideas, and the whole of their works are
as far removed from the new school as the poles are
asunder. The work of the two great painters deals
almost entirely with expression, that of the impressionists
with colour harmonies. In the one case
intellectual beauty is sought to accompany the
sensorial, in the other the production of beauty
which is not purely or almost entirely sensorial, is
not even pretended. While these differences are
obvious, and while no man of ordinary intelligence is
likely to be confused in his mind in respect of them,
the fact remains that the movement, which was
born with Impressionism some forty years ago, to
raise Rembrandt and Velasquez to an elevation in
art to which they are not entitled, has met with
much success amongst that considerable section of
the community which is interested in art and appreciates
its value, but suffers from the delusion that
special knowledge, which it has not acquired, is
necessary for the recognition of high &aelig;sthetic merit.
No definite propositions have been laid down in
support of the movement: there has been no line
of reasoning for the critic to handle, nor have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
old standards been upset in the slightest degree:
the position has been brought about chiefly by a
continuous reiteration of vague assertions and
mystic declarations, and by the glamour arising
from the enormous prices paid by collectors for the
works of the masters named, consequent upon the
skilful commercial exploitation of this exaggerated
approbation.</p>

<p>Portraiture is necessarily on a lower scale of art
than historical painting (using this term in its
higher application), firstly because ideals are not
possible therein, and secondly in that the imagination
of the artist is very restricted. The greatest
portrait ever painted is immeasurably below a picture
where a beautiful ideal form, with ideal expression
is depicted; as far below in fact as the best
ancient sculptured busts were inferior to the gods
of Praxiteles. Neither Rembrandt nor Velasquez
was capable of idealization of form, and so neither
left behind him a single painted figure to take its
place as a type. Rembrandt was a master of human
expression, and in the representation of character
he was perhaps unsurpassed by any painter, but if
we analyze the feeling that is at the bottom of the
appreciation of his portraits, we find that it largely
consists of something apart from admiration of them
as things of beauty. There enters into consideration
recognition of the extraordinary genius of the
artist in presenting character in such a way that
the want of corporeal beauty seems to be unfelt.
Instead of observing that the expression in a countenance
harmonizes with the features, we involuntarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>notice that the features harmonize perfectly
with the expression, which seems in itself to be the
picture. Of course inasmuch as the expression
invariably appeals to the good side of our nature,
it means intellectual beauty, but as the depth of
any impression of this kind of beauty depends upon
the development of the mind, the admiration must,
except where the artist presents corporeal beauty,
be confined generally to the cultivated section of
the community. From the point of view of pure
art, his fame as a great painter can only rest upon
those of his pictures which are also appreciated for
the corporeal beauty exhibited.</p>

<p>The extraordinary power of Velasquez lay in the
sure freedom of his execution, and in this he was equal
to Titian. He was besides a master of balance, and
so every portrait he painted is one complete whole,
and has exactly the effect that a portrait should
have&mdash;to direct the mind of the observer to the
subject, and away altogether from the painter.
But these high qualities as portrait painters do not
place Rembrandt and Velasquez on a level with
Raphael, and Michelangelo, and Correggio. Whatever
the individual opinion, it is impossible to move
aside from the long path of experience and the laws
dependent upon natural functions, and so long as
the world lasts, a work of ideal beauty, whether it
be a Madonna by Raphael, a Prophet by Michelangelo,
or a symbolical figure by Fragonard, will live
in general estimation, which is the only test of high
beauty, far above portraits from life and scenes of
every day labour, however they may be painted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>The beauty of the one is eternal and exalting; and
of the other, sympathetic and more or less passive.
The appreciation of Raphael and Michelangelo is
universal, spontaneous, emphatic; of Rembrandt
and Velasquez, sometimes imperative, but usually
deliberative and cultivated. In fact it is only
amongst a section of cultivated people, that is to
say, a small percentage of the community, that Rembrandt
and Velasquez are given a status which is not,
and cannot be, accorded them if we adhere to the
natural and time-honoured standards of judgment
accepted by the first artists and philosophers known
to the world since art emerged from the prehistoric
shade. To place these artists above, or on a level
with, the Italian artists named, is to cast from their
pedestals Homer, Phidias, Praxiteles, Apelles, Shakespeare,
Dante, and every other admittedly sublime
genius in art of whom we have record.</p>

<p>Another baneful result of Impressionism is the
attempt to raise landscape to a higher level in art
than that to which it is properly entitled. This is
perhaps a natural consequence of the elevation of
colour at the expense of form, for the movement is
based upon new methods of colouring, and the
significance of colour is vastly greater in landscape
than in any other branch of art. Elsewhere the
disabilities of the landscape painter are pointed out,
and it will be seen that fixed and unalterable restrictions
compel an extreme limitation to his work. It
is because of these restrictions that the very greatest
artists have refrained from paying close attention
to this branch of art as a separate department.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>From indirect records we may presume that
landscape painting was well understood in the days
of ancient Greece, but there is no evidence that it
then formed a separate branch of art. In Roman
times according to Pliny, landscape was used for
mural decoration. Of its character we can only
judge from the examples exposed during the excavations
at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which indicate
that the pictures had but a topographical interest,
or formed settings for the representation of industrial
pursuits or classical adventures. Certainly there
is no instance in Greek or Roman art recorded or
exhibited, of any landscape as we understand it,
that is, a work built up as a beautiful representation
of nature, to be instantly recognized by the observer
as a complete whole, as one sign in fact. The artists
of the Italian Renaissance did not paint landscapes
as separate pictures unless by way of study or experiment.
They evidently considered landscape signs
purely as accessories, and composed their natural
views with special reference to figure designs. Some
of them, particularly the leaders of the Venetian
School, occasionally painted pictures in which landscape
appears to play an important part, but in
these cases the landscape is really subsidiary, though
essential to the design; and the works cannot be
compared in any way with those of Claude and others
who often added figures to their landscapes in order
to comply with the wishes of their patrons. The
fifteenth century Flemish artists also dealt with
landscape purely as background, and so with Martin
Schongauer, D&uuml;rer, and other early German paint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ers.
But all the great painters down to the decline
of the Renaissance, closely studied landscape, as is
evidenced by the numerous sketches still existing,
and the finished pictures remaining clearly indicate
that by the middle of the sixteenth century artists
had little or nothing to learn in landscape art, save
the management of complex aerial perspective.</p>

<p>Since landscape painting was introduced as a
separate art towards the end of the sixteenth century,
it has only commanded general attention when
the higher art of the painter has appeared to decline.
In Flanders the spurt in landscape due to Paul Bril
was terminated with the last of the Breughels by
the overpowering splendour of Rubens in historical
work, and the attempts of even Rubens himself to
create a greater interest in landscape signally failed.
There were some good landscape painters in Holland
during the flourishing period of the Dutch
school, but it was only when Rembrandt, Dow,
Terburg, and the rest of the bright constellation of
figure painters had passed their zenith, or were
resting in quiet graves, that landscape painting
became in any way general. Then it was that
Hobbema, Jacob Ruysdael, and their numerous
followers, with coast painters like Van der Cappelle,
and sea painters as William van de Velde, turned
out the many fine works which are now so highly
prized.</p>

<p>The Italians of the seventeenth century were too
close to Raphael, and Michelangelo, and Titian,
to permit of a landscape being generally received as
a great work of art, but there appeared at this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
in Rome numerous foreigners from France, and
Flanders, and Holland, who were devoted to landscape,
and amongst them the greatest genius known
in the art&mdash;Claude Lorraine. He was the first to
put the sun in the sky on canvas for the purpose of
pure landscape; the first to master thoroughly the
intricate difficulties of aerial perspective; the first
to adorn the earth with fairy castles and dreamy
visions of nature, such as we might suppose to have
been common in the days of the Golden Age, ere
yet men fought for power, or toiled from morn to
eve for daily bread. With his magic wand he
skimmed the cream of natural beauty and spread
it over the Roman Campagna, transforming this
historic ground into a region of palaces, terraces,
cascades, and glorious foliage. At the same time
Nicholas Poussin was also using the Campagna for
the landscape settings of his classical compositions&mdash;such
perfect settings that it is impossible to imagine
the figures separated from their surroundings.
These two artists with their disciples, and many
Flemish and Dutch painters headed by Berghem
and the two Boths, formed a landscape colony of
considerable importance, but no Italian landscape
school was founded from it. In the next century
there was little pure landscape in Italy. Some fine
works of topographical, and a few of general interest
were produced by Canaletto and his followers, and
a kind of landscape school was maintained in Venice
for half a century or more, but elsewhere in Italy
the cultivation of landscape was spasmodic and
feeble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In England and France, landscape as a separate
art has only made considerable headway quite recently,
though there have been local schools, as the
Norwich and Barbizon, which followed particular
methods in design. Meanwhile England produced
some isolated giants in landscape, as Wilson, Gainsborough,
Turner, and Constable, Turner standing
out as the greatest painter of strong sun effects on
record. It will be seen that until the last generation
or so, in no country has landscape been admitted to
high rank as a separate art, universal opinion very
properly recognizing that the highest beauty in the
handiwork of man is to be found in the representation
of the human figure. Profound efforts of the
imagination are not required in landscape, for it
consists of a particular arrangement of inanimate
signs which have no direct influence upon the mind,
and cannot appeal to the higher faculties. There
is no scope therein for lofty conceptions, and consequently
the sensorial beauty exhibited must be
very high to have more than a quickly passing
effect upon the observer. This high beauty is most
difficult to obtain, and can only be reached by those
who have a supreme knowledge of the technique of
their art; who have made a long and close study
of natural signs and effects; and who are possessed
of uncommon patience and industry. We need not
be surprised that scarcely one out of every hundred
landscape painters executes a work which lasts a
generation, and not one out of a thousand secures a
permanent place on the roll of art. The man who
does not give his life from his youth up, to his work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
concentrating his whole energy upon it, to the exclusion
of everything else, will paint only inferior landscapes.
The four greatest landscape painters known
to us are Claude and Turner in distance work,
and Hobbema and Jacob Ruysdael in near-ground.
Claude was labouring for twenty-five years before
he succeeded in accomplishing a single example of
those lovely fairy abodes so forcibly described by
Goethe as "absolute truth without a sign of reality."
Turner took more than twenty years to master the
secrets of Claude; Jacob Ruysdael spent a quarter
of a century in working out to perfection the representation
of flowing water, and Hobbema passed
through more than half of his long life before arriving
at his superlative scheme of increasing his available
distance by throwing in a powerful sunlight
from the back of his trees. And a long list of landscape
painters of lesser lustre might be given, who
went through from fifteen to thirty years of painstaking
labour before executing a single first-class
picture.</p>

<p>Great landscapes of the pure variety are of two
kinds, and two kinds only. The highest are those
where an illusion of opening distance or other movement
is provided, and the second class are where
natural scenes of common experience, under common
conditions of atmosphere, are faithfully reproduced.
The lighter landscapes representing phases,
as the sketches of the Barbizon school,<a name="Eanchor_18" id="Eanchor_18"></a><a href="#Enote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> with the
moonlight scenes, and the thousand and one sentimental
colour harmonies unconcerned with human
motives, which are turned out with such painful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
regularity every month, serve their purpose as wall
decorations of the moment, but then die and fade
from memory like so many of the unfortunate artists
who drag their weary way to the grave in the vain
struggle for fame by means of them.</p>

<p>No landscape of the phase class can be anything
more than a simple harmony of tone and design,
more ephemeral than the natural phase itself. The
quiet harmony is restful for the fatigued eye, and
every eye is fatigued every day; and because the
eye feels relieved in glancing at the picture, the
conclusion arises to the unthinking that it must be
a great work of art. Glowing eulogies were pronounced
upon Whistler's Nocturne, in the Metropolitan
Museum of New York, when it was first
placed there, but is there anything less like a work
of beauty than the dark meaningless patch as it is
now seen? And the same thing has happened with
a thousand other landscapes of the kind&mdash;first
presented to the tired eyes of business and professional
men, and then placed in collections to be
surrounded by permanently beautiful works. All
these phase pictures must quickly lose their beauty
in accordance with natural laws which cannot be
varied. Let it not be supposed that the writer
means to suggest that these simple works should
not be executed. They are surely better than no
decoration at all in the many homes for which really
fine pictures are unavailable, but it is entirely wrong
to endeavour to pervert the public judgment by
putting them forward as works of high art.</p>

<p>And what of the struggling artists? Look around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in every city and see the numbers of bright young
men and women wearing away the bloom of their
youth in vain endeavours to climb the heights of
art by the easy track of glowing colours! It is the
call of Fame they think, that leads them along, for
they know not the voice of the siren, and see not
the gaping precipice which is to shatter their dreams.
There is but one sure path to the top of the mountain,
but it is drab-coloured, and many are the slippery
crags. Few of the strongest spirits can climb it,
but all may try, and at least they may direct their
minds upwards, and keep ever in front of them a
vision of the great idealists wandering over the
summit through the eternal glow of the fires they
lit ere death consecrated their glory.</p>

<h3>Classification of the fine arts</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">The arts imitative of nature&mdash;The arts classified according to the
character of their signs&mdash;Poetry not a compound art, primarily&mdash;The
extent to which the arts may improve upon nature.</p>


<p>Since art uses natural signs for the purpose of
representing nature, it is necessarily mimetic in
character.<a name="Eanchor_19" id="Eanchor_19"></a><a href="#Enote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Poetry represents all that the other arts imitate,
and in addition, presumed divine actions. Specially
it imitates human and presumed spiritual actions,
with form and expression; expression directly, form
indirectly.</p>

<p>Sculpture imitates human and presumed spiritual
form and expression; form directly, expression indirectly.
It also represents animal forms, and modifications
of natural forms in ornament.</p>

<p>Painting imitates natural forms and products, and
specially human form and expression; form directly,
expression indirectly.</p>

<p>Fiction imitates human actions, and form and
expression; expression directly, form indirectly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Music imitates natural sounds and combines them
and specially represents human emotional effects.</p>

<p>Architecture is the least imitative of the arts, its
freedom in the representation of nature being restricted
by the necessity of serving the end of utility.
It combines geometrical forms, and in the positions
and proportions of these, is compelled to represent
what we understand from experience of nature as
natural balance.</p>

<p>The poet may give to a character sublime attributes
far above experience, or expand form as Homer
raises the stature of Strife to the heavens, but he
cannot provide attributes beyond experience in kind,
or any part of a form outside of nature. He may
combine or rearrange, and enlarge or diminish as he
will, and so may the painter, the sculptor, or musician,
but he is powerless to create signs unknown to
nature. It follows then, that he who imitates nature
in the most beautiful way, that is to say, he who
combines the signs of nature to form the most beautiful
whole, produces the greatest work of art.</p>

<p>It would appear that upon the character of their
principal signs is dependent the relative position of
the arts in respect of the recognition of beauty
therein. Of the six fine arts, namely, Poetry,
Sculpture, Painting, Fiction, Music, and Architecture,
the first four, which hereafter in this work will
be known as the Associated Arts, have for their principal
sign the human figure, to which everything else
is subordinate; while in music the signs consist of
tones, and in architecture, of lines.</p>

<p>All the other arts whose object is to give pleasure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
as the drama, dancing, etching, are either modifications
of one of the fine arts, or combinations of two
or more of them. In recent times it has been held
that poetry is a combined art, owing to the almost
invariable use of a simple form of music in its construction,
but it would appear that primarily poetry
is independent of metrical assistance. This was
clearly laid down by Aristotle, but modern definitions
of the art have usually included some reference
to metre.<a name="Eanchor_20" id="Eanchor_20"></a><a href="#Enote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Now in our common experience two
things are observable in respect of poetry. The first
is, that when by way of admiration or criticism, we
discuss the works of those poets whom all the world
recognizes as the greatest known to us, we deal only
with the substance of what is said, and the manner
of saying it, without reference to the metrical form.
In the second place we observe that the higher the
poetry, the more simple is the metrical form with
which it is associated. The great epics, which necessarily
take first rank in poetry, have only metre, the
higher musical measures in which lyrics are set being
avoided. But as we descend in the scale of the
art, metrical form becomes of more importance, and
when simple subjects are dealt with, and a grand
style is inappropriate, the production would not be
called poetry unless in the form of verse.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>(See <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>)</p>
</div>



<p>In epic and dramatic poetry, we call one poet
greater than another because of his superior invention
and beauty of expression, let the measure be
what it will. But the invention comes first, for only
high invention can be clothed with lofty expression.
The actions of deathless gods or god-like men; qualities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>of goodness, nobility, courage, grandeur, so high
as to be above human reach: only these can form
the subject of language and sentiment soaring into
regions of the sublime, and indifferent to metrical
artifice. In the sacred books of all great religions we
may find the loftiest poetry without regular form,
and any prose translation of the Greek poets will
provide many examples,<a name="Eanchor_21" id="Eanchor_21"></a><a href="#Enote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> though often there is a
cadence&mdash;a rise and fall in the flow of words which is
more or less regular, and has the effect of emphasizing
the sentiment, and of throwing the images upon the
mind with directness and force. We must conclude
then that in poetry, while metrical form is generally
essential, it is not vital to the highest flights of the
poet, and so strictly, poetry is primarily a pure and
not a compound art.</p>

<p>Seeing that art uses the signs of nature of which
man is at once a product and a tool, it must in its
progress follow the general course of nature. In her
development of life, nature is chiefly concerned in the
improvements of types for her own purposes, and
only uses the individual in so far as he can assist in
this end, while the natural instinct of the individual
is to conserve and improve his type. The art which
represents life is compelled to deal chiefly with types,
for it is only by the use of a type that the artist
can apply his imagination to the production of high
beauty, to whatever extent he may use the individual
to help him in this purpose, and it is instinctive in the
human being to maintain and improve the &aelig;sthetic
attraction of the species. The highest art, as the
highest work of nature, consists of the presentation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of a perfected type. The artist therefore must consider
the species before the individual; the essential
before the accidental; the general before the particular.</p>

<p>The living signs of nature with which art deals are
of two classes. In the one sign the position of parts
is the same throughout the species, and is fixed and
invariable, as in fully developed animals; in the other
the position is irregular, and variable within limits,
as in plants. In the latter case the position of parts
may be commonly varied indefinitely without a sense
of incongruity arising, as in a tree, and hence there
can be no conceivable general form or type upon
which art may build up perfected parts and proportions.
In respect of such a sign therefore, art cannot
improve, or appear to improve, upon nature, by
combining perfected parts into a more beautiful
whole than nature provides.</p>

<p>In the case of a fully developed animal, where the
position of parts is fixed, a type may be conceived
which is superior in symmetry and harmony to any
individual of the species produced by nature, for the
imagination is restricted to an unchangeable form,
and has but to put together perfected parts and
proportions. But this conception can only be applied
in art to human beings, because in respect of other
animals, while no two are alike, the members of each
species, or each section of a species, seem to be alike,
or so closely alike in form and expression, that no
perfected type can be conceived which will appear
to be superior in general beauty to the normal individual
of the species, or section thereof, coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
within actual experience. Thus, the most perfect
conceivable racehorse painted on canvas, might in
reality be more perfect in form than any actual racehorse,
but to the observer of the picture it would not
appear to be of greater perfection or higher beauty
than racehorses that come, or may come, within
experience. The poet may describe the actions and
appearance of a courser in such a way as to suggest
that the animal has qualities far above experience,
but the form of the animal when thrown on the mind
of the reader, would still appear to be within the
bounds of experience.</p>

<p>With the human being, in addition to the general
form there enters into consideration the countenance,
which is the all-important seat of beauty, is the
principal key to expression, and which, to the common
knowledge, differs in every person in character
and proportions. Nature never produces a perfect
form with a perfect countenance, and she actually
refuses to provide a countenance which is free from
elements connected with purely human instincts and
passions. But it is within the power of art to correct
the work of nature in these respects&mdash;to put together
perfect parts, and to provide a general expression
approaching our highest conceptions of human
majesty. Homer, Phidias, and Raphael have enabled
us to throw upon our minds images far above
any of actual experience.</p>

<p>Apart from these ideal forms, nature cannot be
surpassed by art in the production of beauty, either
in respect of animate or inanimate signs, separately
or collectively, the latter because within the limita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tions
of art, there is no grouping or arrangement of
signs possible which would not appear to correspond
with what may be observed in nature, unless something
abnormal and less beautiful than any natural
combination be presented.</p>

<p>Poetry, painting, and sculpture may be concerned
with ideals. In fiction an ideal is impossible because
the writer must treat of life as it is, or as it appears
to be, within the bounds of experience. In neither
music nor architecture is there a basic sign or combination
of signs upon which the imagination may
build up an ideal.</p>

<h3>LAW OF RECOGNITION IN THE ASSOCIATED ARTS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Explanation of the law&mdash;Its application to poetry&mdash;To sculpture&mdash;To
painting&mdash;To fiction.</p>


<p>While we are unable to explain, logically and
completely, our appreciation of what we understand
as beauty, experience has taught us that there are
certain phenomena connected with &aelig;sthetic perception
which are so regular and undeviating in their
application as to have all the force of law. The first
and most important of these phenomena relates to
the interval of time elapsing between the sense perception
of a thing of art, and the recognition by the
mind of the beauty therein.</p>

<p>We know from common experience of the Associated
Arts that if one fails to appreciate a work
almost immediately after comprehending its nature
and purport, he arrives at the conclusion that there
is no beauty therein, or at least that the beauty is so
obscure as to be scarcely worth consideration. But
sometimes on further acquaintance with the work
the view of the observer may be changed, and he
may become aware of a certain beauty which he did
not before appreciate. We notice also that when the
beauty is comparatively high, it is more rapidly rec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ognized
than when it is comparatively low. Continuing
the examination we arrive at what is evidently
an unalterable law, namely, that the higher
the &aelig;sthetic value in a particular sphere of art, the
more rapidly is the beauty therein recognized; that
is to say, given any two works, other things being
equal, that is the higher art the beauty in which is
the more quickly conveyed to the mind of the observer
after contact with it, and precisely to the
extent to which the reasoning powers are required
to be exercised in comprehending the work, so the
beauty therein is diminished. The law may be called
for convenience the Law of Recognition.</p>

<p>But there are different kinds of beauty as well as
degrees. One kind may be more quickly recognized,
and yet make a weaker impression on the mind, a
condition which is due to the varying relations between
the sensorial and intellectual elements in the
works. We note that in all the Associated Arts, as
the works therein descend in &aelig;sthetic value, the
emotional element becomes more evident, and consequently
the impression received, less permanent.
But sensorial beauty is the first essential in a work of
art: hence while the direct appeal to the mind must
be made as strong as possible, this must not be done
at the expense of the emotional elements. We unconsciously
measure the emotional with the intellectual
effect, and if the former does not at least equal
the latter, we reject the work as inferior art. A
painted Madonna wanting in beauty of features is
instantly and properly condemned even if her figure
be enshrined within surroundings of saintly glories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
which in themselves make a powerful appeal to the
mind. In fact the highest reaches in art were probably
originally suggested by the necessity of balancing
the one with the other form of beauty. The
highest intellectual considerations seem to rise far
above any emotional experiences connected with
ordinary life, and hence to enable these considerations
to enter the domain of art, the divine must be
introduced so that the artist may extend his imaginative
scope for the provision of emotional effects
commensurate, as far as possible, with the importance
of his appeal to the mind. Hence in all arts
which combine an intellectual with an emotional
appeal, the highest forms must ever be connected
with the spiritual.</p>

<p>In other grades of these arts also, the artist has to
use special means to maintain a due balance between
the two kinds of beauty. Shakespeare could
not give men and women of every-day experience the
wisdom, the judgment, and the foresight necessary
for the presentation of the powerful pictures which
some of his characters throw upon the mind, so he
raises them above the level of life by according them
greater virtues and nobler passions than are to be
found in people of actual experience. The supreme
emotional effects he produces seem perfectly appropriate
therefore to the intellectual appeals. In the
next lower form of art, where the representation does
not go beyond life experience, the emotional appeal
is of still greater relative importance because the
appeal to the mind is rarely striking. The emotional
effect here may indeed be so overpowering that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
purely mental considerations are lost sight of, and
we observe that in all the greater works of art in the
division, whether of poetry, painting, sculpture, or
fiction, the intellectual appeal is vastly exceeded by
the emotional. When we reach the grade which
deals with subjects inferior to the average level of
human life, as the representation of animals, landscape,
humour, still-life, the sensorial effect must
be exceedingly strong relatively, otherwise the art
would scarcely be recognizable, the appeal to the
mind being necessarily weak.</p>

<p>It is clearly compulsory then that the Associated
Arts, all of which may appeal to the mind as well as
to the senses, should be separated into divisions for
the purpose of applying the Law of Recognition, and
these divisions are obvious, for they are marked by
the strongest natural boundary lines. They are: 1.
The art which deals with divinities. 2. That which
exhibits beauty above life experience, but does not
reach the divine. 3. That which represents life.
4. That which produces representations inferior to
life. This separation corresponds with that applied
by Aristotle to poetry and painting, except that he
joined the two first sections into one, which he described
as better than life. But the division of the
great philosopher, while being sufficient for his purpose,
is hardly close enough for the full consideration
of the kinds of beauty, since it puts in the same class,
representations of the divinity and the superman&mdash;joins
Homer and Phidias with Praxiteles and Raphael.
In dealing with the divine the artist need place
no limit to his imagination in the presentation of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
picture, whereas with the superman he must circumscribe
his fancy within the limits of what may appear
to the senses to be possibly natural. It is true that
the poet may use the supernatural as distinguished
from the divine, to enable him to extend his imaginative
scope, and so give us beautiful pictures which
would be otherwise unpresentable. Shakespeare
makes us imagine Puck encircling the earth in forty
minutes, and Shelley shows us iron-winged beings
climbing the wind, but we immediately recognize
these pictures as figures of fancy, or as in the nature
of allegory, and they do not impress us so deeply as
the miraculous flight of a goddess of Homer, or an
assemblage of the satellites of Satan in the Hell of
Milton, for we involuntarily regard these events as
compatible with the religious faith of great nations,
and so as having a nearer apparent semblance of
truth. Sacred art therefore, being capable of providing
beauty of a much higher kind than any other
form, should be placed in a separate section for the
purpose of considering the law under discussion.
Only poetry among the arts is capable of appropriately
representing divine actions, and only sculpture
of producing a form so perfect as to bring a divinity
to mind. Hence these arts are alone concerned with
the Law of Recognition as applied to the first section
of the Associated Arts.</p>

<p>The law applies to all the Associated Arts, and to
all sections of them, except the lowest form of painting&mdash;that
represented by harmony of colour without
appeal to the mind of any kind&mdash;but this form is so
weak and exceptional that it need hardly be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>sidered
in the general proposition. Indeed we might
reasonably argue that it does not come within the
fine arts, as it is produced by a mechanical arrangement
of things with fixed and unalterable physical
properties.</p>

<p>The law cannot apply to music and architecture,
for the effects of these are purely emotional, and so
directly vary with conditions of time and place respectively.
A work of architecture may seem more
beautiful in one place than in another; and a work of
music more or less beautiful according as it more or
less synchronizes with emotional conditions of human
activity surrounding the hearer at the time of the
performance.</p>

<p>While this law is unvarying in the Associated Arts,
there are artificial restrictions which must be considered
in order that apparent deviations from it
may be understood. Special restrictions in relation
to the higher poetry and sculpture are mentioned
later on, but there is also an important general restriction.
The sense nerves and the imagination, like
all other functions, must be exercised in order that
normal healthy conditions may be retained; but a
large section of the people, by force of circumstances
or want of will, have neglected this exercise, and so
through disuse or misuse these functions are often in
a condition which is little more than rudimentary.
Hence such persons are practically debarred from
appreciation of many forms of art, and particularly
those wherein intellectual beauty is a marked feature.
In discussing the operation of this law amongst people
in general therefore, the writer must be understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to refer only to that section of the community whose
sense nerves and imaginations may be supposed to
be in a healthy, active condition.</p>

<p>Experience with all the Associated Arts has clearly
demonstrated the validity of this law. The strength
of the devices used by the poet lies in simplifying the
presentation of his pictures. Metaphor is necessary
to the poet, for without it he would be powerless to
present pictures made up of a number of parts, but
he also uses it for the purpose of throwing simple
images upon the mind more rapidly, and consequently
more forcibly, than would be possible if direct means
were employed; and the beauty of the metaphor
appears the greater according as it more completely
fills in the picture which the poet is desirous of presenting.
When other artifices than metaphor or
simile are applied, the result only appears very beautiful
when the condensation of the language used is
extreme, and when there is no break in the delineation
of the action. A few supreme examples of
beauty derived from the principal devices of the poet
for presenting his pictures may be instanced, and it
will be found that in each case the power of the image
is directly due to the brevity of expression, the
simplicity of description and metaphor, or the unimpeded
representation of action.</p>

<p>More than three thousand years have passed since
the period assigned to Helen of Troy, and yet each
generation of men and women as they learn of her,
have deeply sealed upon their minds the impression
that she was of surpassing beauty, almost beyond the
reach of human conception. We have practically no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
details of her appearance from Homer or Hesiod,
except that she was neat-ankled, white-armed, rich-haired,
and had the sparkling eyes of the Graces, but
already in the time of Hesiod her renown "spread
over the earth." What was it then that established
the eternal fame of her beauty? Simply a few words
of Homer indicating the startling effect of her appearance
before the elders of Troy. We are allowed to
infer that these dry, shrunken-formed sages, shrill-voiced
with age, became passionately disturbed by a
mere glance at her figure, and nervously agreed with
each other that little blame attached to the Greeks
and Trojans for suffering such long and severe hardships
on account of her, for only with the goddesses
could she be compared. How wondrous must be the
beauty when a glimpse of it suffices to hasten the
blood through shrivelled veins, and provoke tempestuous
currents to awake atrophied nerves! Without
the record of this incident, the vague notices of
Helen's appearance would be very far from sufficient
to account for the universal recognition of her marvellous
beauty.<a name="Eanchor_22" id="Eanchor_22"></a><a href="#Enote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>One of the finest lines of Shakespeare is, "How
sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank." The
beauty of the line rests entirely upon the use of the
word "sleeps" to express something which could not
be otherwise said without the use of many words.
The moonbeam is apparently perfectly still, the
atmosphere calm, and there is nothing in the surroundings
to disturb the natural tranquillity, these
conditions inducing a feeling of softness and rest in
the observer. If it had been necessary to say all this,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Shakespeare would certainly have omitted reference to
the moonlight, but his powerful imagination brings to
mind the word "sleeps" to express the conditions, and
we are overwhelmed with a beautiful picture suddenly
thrown on the brain as if by a brilliant flash of light.</p>

<p>Among the many illustrations of the point which
may be found in the Bible, is the great passage,
"And God said, 'Let there be Light,' and there was
Light." This is described by Longinus as nobly
expressed, but he does not suggest any cause for its
&aelig;sthetic effect. It is true that nothing could be
finer, but the nobility of the expression is derived
from its brevity&mdash;from the extreme rapidity with
which so vast and potent an event as an act of creation
is pictured on the brain.<a name="Eanchor_23" id="Eanchor_23"></a><a href="#Enote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> A description of an
act of creation, although involving psychological
considerations of sublimity, is not necessarily so
beautiful in expression as to be a work of art.</p>

<p>In the case of lyric poetry, brevity of expression,
though still of high importance, is not of so much
moment as in epic or dramatic verse, because the
substance is subordinated to beauty of expression
and musical form. Devices are used chiefly for
strengthening the sensorial element, the appeal to the
mind being in most cases secondary. Nevertheless
the lyric poet wastes no words. Take for example
Sappho's <i>Ode to Anactoria</i>. The substance of these
amazing lines is comparatively insignificant, being
merely the expression of emotion on the part of an
individual consequent upon disappointment, yet the
transcendent beauty of the poem has held enthralled
fourscore generations of men and women, and still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the world gasps with astonishment at its perfection.
Obviously the beauty of the ode rests mainly on
qualities of form which cannot be reproduced in
translation, but the substance may be, and it will be
observed that the description of the action is unsurpassable.
The picture, the whole picture, and
nothing but the picture, is thrown on the mind
rapidly and directly; so rapidly that the movement
of the brush is scarcely discernible, and so simply
that not a thought is required for its elucidation.
With the chain of symptoms broken or less closely
connected, the passion indicated would be comparatively
feeble, whatever the force of the artifices in
rhythm and expression which Sappho knew so well
how to employ.<a name="Eanchor_24" id="Eanchor_24"></a><a href="#Enote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>As with poetry, so with the arts of sculpture and
painting: the greatest works result from simple
designs. All the sculptures which we recognize as
sublime or highly beautiful, consist of single figures,
or in very rare cases, groups of two or three, and
indeed it is difficult to hold in our minds a carved
group of several figures. The images of the Zeus and
Athena of Phidias, though we know little of them
except from literary records and inferior copies, are
far more brilliantly mirrored upon our minds than
the Parthenon reliefs. The importance of simplicity
is perhaps more readily seen in sculpture than in any
other art, for the slightest fault in design has an
immediate effect upon the mind of the observer. It
is noticeable that the decadence of a great art period
is usually first marked by complications in sculptured
figures.<a name="Eanchor_25" id="Eanchor_25"></a><a href="#Enote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>In painting, the pictures which we regard as great
are characterized by their simplicity, and the immediate
recognition of their purport. They are
either ideal figures, or groups where at least the
central figure is idealized and commonly known.
The work must be grasped at one glance for the
beauty to be of a high order. Hence in the case of
frescoes great artists have not attempted to make the
beauty of any part dependent upon the comprehension
of the whole. It is impossible for the eye to take
in at a single glance the whole of a large fresco painting,
and this explains why a fresco celebrated for its
beauty is often disappointing to one who sees it for
the first time, and endeavours to impress it on his
mind as a single picture by rapidly piecing together
the different parts.<a name="Eanchor_26" id="Eanchor_26"></a><a href="#Enote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Polygnotus could well paint
forty scenes from Homer as mural decoration in one
hall, for they could only be examined and understood
as separate pictures; and the ceiling of Michelangelo
at the Vatican is so arranged that there is no necessity
for combining the parts in the mind. So with
the Parma frescoes of Correggio. Raphael had a
different task in his Vatican frescoes, but he accomplished
it by arranging his figures so that each separate
group is a beautiful picture; and Lionardo in
his great work at Milan divided the Apostles into
groups of three in order to minimize the consideration
necessary for the appreciation of so large a work.</p>

<p>Fiction is divided into two sections, the novel and
the short story, and they are so distinct in character
that they must necessarily be considered separately
in the application of the law under discussion. Form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
is of high importance in both classes of the art, but
weighs more in the short story because here the
appeal to the mind is unavoidably restricted. The
novelist is capable of producing a higher beauty than
is within the range of the short-story writer. The
latter is limited in his delineation of character to the
circumstances surrounding a single experience, while
the novelist, in describing various experiences, may
add shade upon shade in expression and thus elevate
the characters and actions above the level possible
of attainment by means of a single incident. But
within his limit the short-story writer may provide
his beauty more easily than the novelist, because a
picture can be more readily freed from complications
when away from surroundings, than when it forms
one of a series of pictures which must have connecting
links. A good short story consists of a single incident
or experience in a life history. It is clearly cut, without
introduction, and void of a conclusion which is
not directly part of the incident. The subject is of
general interest; the language simple, of common use,
and free from mannerisms; while there are no accessories
beyond those essential for the comprehension
of the scheme. These conditions, which imply the
most extreme simplicity, are present in all the
greatest short stories known to us&mdash;the best works of
the author of the <i>Contes Nouvelles</i>, of Sacchetti,
Boccaccio, Margaret of Navarre, Hoffman, Poe, and
De Maupassant. The novel differs from the short
story in that it is a large section of a life with many
experiences, but the principles under which the two
varieties of fiction are built up, are precisely the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Obviously the limit in length of a novel is that point
beyond which the writer cannot enhance the beauty
of character and action, while maintaining the unity
of design. This means the concentration of effort in
the direction of simplicity, facilitating the rapid reception
of the pictures presented by the writer upon
the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that the higher the beauty in
the Associated Arts, the simpler are the signs or sign
combinations which produce it; and hence the Law
of Recognition rests on a secure foundation, for the
simple must necessarily be recognized before the
complex.</p>

<h2><br /><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>LAW OF GENERAL ASSENT</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">General opinion the test of beauty in the Associated Arts.</p>


<p>The first aim of art is sensorial beauty, because
sensorial experience must precede the impression of
beauty upon the mind. The extent to which something
appears to be sensorially harmonious depends
upon the condition or character of the nerves conveying
the impression of it to the brain. We know
from experience that exercise of these nerves results
in the removal or partial removal of natural irregularities
therein, and enables a complex form of beauty
to be recognized which was not before perceived.
The vast majority of the people have not cultivated
their sense nerves except involuntarily, and consequently
can only recognize more or less simple beauty:
thus, as the sign combinations become more complicated,
so is diminished the number of persons
capable of appreciating the beauty thereof.</p>

<p>The highest form of beauty conceivable to the
imagination is that of the human being, because here
corporeal and intellectual beauty may be combined.
This is universally admitted and has been so since
the first records of mental activity. The human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
figure must be regarded as a single sign since the
relation of its parts to each other is fixed and invariable;
and further it is the simplest, because of all
signs none is so quickly recognized by the rudimentary
understanding. In the Associated Arts therefore,
the highest beauty is to be found in the simplest
sign, and this is the one supremely important sign
in these arts, for without it only the lowest forms
may be produced.</p>

<p>From all this we determine that the higher the
beauty in a work of the Associated Arts, the larger
is the number of persons capable of recognizing it;
so that if we say that something in these arts is
beautiful because it pleases, we imply that it is still
more beautiful if we say that it generally pleases,
and the highest of all standards of beauty is involved
in the interpretation of Longinus: "That is sublime
and beautiful which always pleases, and takes equally
with all sorts of men." Thus, in the Associated Arts,
the general opinion as to the &aelig;sthetic value of a work
of high art is both demonstration and law.<a name="Eanchor_27" id="Eanchor_27"></a><a href="#Enote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>In music the significance of the signs is inverted
compared with the progression in the Associated
Arts, for while in the latter the highest form of beauty
is produced by the simplest of single signs, in music
the higher forms are the result of complex combinations
of signs. The greatest musical compositions
consist of an immense variety of signs arranged in a
hitherto unknown order. Thus, while the immature
or uncultivated mind recognizes the higher forms of
beauty before the lower in the Associated Arts, it
first recognizes the lower forms in music. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Associated Arts therefore, cultivation results in the
further appreciation of the forms of art as they descend,
and in music as they ascend.</p>

<p>In painting, the most uncultivated persons, even
those who have never exercised their organs of sight
except involuntarily, will always admire the higher
forms before the lower.<a name="Eanchor_28" id="Eanchor_28"></a><a href="#Enote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> They will more highly
appreciate a picture of a Madonna or other beautiful
woman than an interior where the scene is comparatively
complicated by the presence of several persons,
and they will prefer the interior to a landscape, and
a landscape to a still-life picture. So in sculpture.
Other things being equal, a figure of a man or woman
will be preferred to a group, and the group to an
animal or decorative ornament. An exception must
however be made in respect of the sublime reaches of
Grecian sculpture in the fifth and fourth centuries
<small>B.C.</small>, owing to an artificial restriction. There is very
little of this sculpture to be actually seen, nearly all
the more important works being known only from
records or variable copies. Considerable observation,
comparison, and study, are necessary before one can
gain a fair conception of the Grecian ideals, and so
they are practically lost to the bulk of the people.</p>

<p>In fiction it is common knowledge that the greatest
works from the point of view of art are always the
most popular, as they are invariably the most simple
in construction and diction. In considering poetry
we must exclude the great epics, as those of Homer,
Virgil, Dante, and Milton, because where the actions
of supernatural persons are described, the sentiments
and language employed are so elevated in character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and the images and literary references so numerous,
that a certain superior education is required before
the sense of the poems can be comprehended. Subject
to this artificial restriction, the rule holds entirely
good. Shakespeare is at once the greatest and
most popular of our poets: Shelley, Byron, and
Burns, are as far ahead of Tennyson and Browning
in popularity as they are in general beauty and
simplicity.</p>

<p>In music on the other hand the lower forms are the
simplest and consequently the most popular. Songs,
dance measures, and ditties of various kinds, are
enjoyed by the mass of the people in preference to
Beethoven and Wagner, a certain cultivation of the
aural nerves being necessary for the appreciation of
the greater artists. The architect is under the necessity
of meeting the ends of utility, but subject to this
restriction it is obvious that simplicity must be the
keynote to his design, for the highest quality of
beauty in his power to produce is grandeur, and this
diminishes with an increase in the complexity of his
sign combinations. The combination of simplicity
with grandeur is the first form of beauty that would
be recognized by the immature eye, and consequently
in respect of the general test of art excellence, architecture
falls into line with the Associated Arts, and
not with music.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be understood how
it is that in the Associated Arts opinion as to the
&aelig;sthetic value of particular works begins to differ
as soon as we leave the recognized masterpieces of
the first rank, and why the divergence widens with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
every step downwards. As the character of the art is
lowered so is diminished the number of persons capable
of appreciating it. In painting and sculpture
this diminution is direct with the increased complexity
of the signs used, and indirect according as the
character of the signs weakens. In poetry the same
rule applies generally, but in the lower forms alliance
with the art of music may bring about a variation.
Only the very lowest forms of music may be used
with the higher forms of poetry because the poet must
have the minimum of restriction when dealing with
the character and actions of the personages who constitute
the principal signs in his work, but as the
art descends the musical form becomes of more importance,
and the substance more simple. Hence the
sensorial beauty of a lyric may be appreciated more
quickly than that of a poem which is, in substance,
of a much higher order, though the kind of beauty
recognized will differ in the two cases. But even in
the greatest lyric the musical form is comparatively
very simple, its beauty being recognized without
special cultivation of the aural nerves: thus, subject
to the division of poetry into its natural grades&mdash;the
two sections where substance and form respectively
predominate&mdash;the measure of its beauty is the extent
to which it is generally appreciated. None of the
other Associated Arts may be allied with a second
art without crippling it as a fine art, because of the
extraordinary limitations forced upon the artist by
the alliance; and hence in respect of sculpture, painting,
and fiction, there is no exception to the rule that
the beauty capable of being produced diminishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
strictly with an increase in the complexity of the
signs used.</p>

<p>These facts appear sufficiently to establish what
may be called the Law of General Assent in the
Associated Arts; that is to say, in the arts of poetry,
sculpture, painting, and fiction, the supreme test of
the &aelig;sthetic value of a work, is general opinion; and
a corollary of this is that the smaller the number of
persons to whom a work of one of these arts appeals,
the weaker is the art therein.</p>

<h3>LIMITATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATED ARTS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">The production of beauty in the respective arts&mdash;How they differ
in scope.</p>


<p>The Associated Arts have all the same method
of producing beauty: they throw pictures on the
brain.<a name="Eanchor_29" id="Eanchor_29"></a><a href="#Enote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Sensorial or intellectual beauty, or both
together, may be exhibited, but in the arts of the
painter and sculptor the picture is transferred to the
brain through the optic nerves, and is necessarily
presented before the intellect can be brought to bear
upon the impression. The arts of the poet and the
story writer involve the presentation of a picture
representing the complete composition, and in addition
when the work is lengthy, of a series of pictures
each of which strengthens the relief of the general
design. The painter and sculptor each presents a
complete picture, the meaning of which is immediately
determined through the sense of sight, and the
extent of the beauty is bounded by what can be
recognized by this sense. All the signs necessary to
perfect the composition are simultaneously indicated,
the artist exhibiting at one blow a full description of
what makes up his thing of beauty. But the poet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
cannot so produce a picture because he presents the
parts successively and not simultaneously, and in the
most important of all the forms which he represents&mdash;that
of the human countenance&mdash;both beauty and
expression have to be defined, and the separate elements
are indescribable. Consequently, however, we
may combine the features of a countenance as described
by the poet, we cannot throw a picture of the
whole upon our minds. A particular form of beauty
must be presented to the eye before it can be mentally
pictured. The poet therefore does not attempt
to dovetail his picture of the human form with descriptive
details, but relies upon imagery, suggestion,
or other artifice, to indicate his meaning in the most
rapid way possible.<a name="Eanchor_30" id="Eanchor_30"></a><a href="#Enote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The novelist is in the same
position as the poet in this respect, except that some
of the devices of the latter are denied him.</p>

<p>But although the poet or novelist cannot put together
the parts in his description, he may in certain
cases present natural beauty to the mind, his scope
depending upon the nature of the parts and the extent
to which they depend upon each other for the
completion of the picture. Where the beauty of the
whole rests upon a combination of perfected parts of
form only, as in the case of a horse, then the poet is
able to present beauty of form notwithstanding that
the separate parts are in themselves not beautiful,
though the beauty would be that of the type and
not of the individual. The beauty of a horse depends
upon its possession of a collection of features which
have each a particular significance. If we are able to
recognize from a description that a horse has qualities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of form and action indicating speed, high spirits,
proud bearing, and so on, and at the same time has a
harmonious symmetry in its general outline, a beautiful
animal is thrown on the mind without difficulty.
We readily picture the courser described by Shakespeare
in his <i>Venus and Adonis</i> as a beautiful horse,
but we should not be able to differentiate it from the
courser of Mazeppa. Where the parts of the thing
described are in themselves beautiful, then the poet
may successfully throw on the mind a series of pictures
of &aelig;sthetic interest. Thus, he may call to the
imagination parts of a landscape which are in themselves
beautiful scenes, as for instance a deep gorge
opening on to a lake, or a flowery valley, though the
parts could not be put together on the mind so that
the beauty of the whole may be presented.<a name="Eanchor_31" id="Eanchor_31"></a><a href="#Enote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

</div>

<p>Summing up the limits of the Associated Arts in
the presentation of the two kinds of beauty, the poet
and the novelist can present general or particular
beauty of mind, and general sensorial beauty, but are
powerless with particular sensorial beauty; the sculptor
and painter may present general or particular
sensorial beauty, and general, but not particular,
beauty of mind. Particular sensorial beauty may be
suggested by the poet or novelist, by indicating its
emotional effect, or by symbols in the form of metaphor;
and particular intellectual beauty may be suggested
by the sculptor or painter by representing
the effect in expression of a particular action, or by
symbols in the form of human figures of beauty.</p>


<p>But while the poet cannot throw upon the brain a
particular form of human beauty, he may suggest a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>greater beauty than that which the painter or sculptor
can depict, and further produce emotional effects
relating to spiritual and human actions and passions
which are beyond the plastic arts: hence his art is
capable of the highest reaches. Next to him come
the sculptor and painter, for they may represent ideal
forms which must be excluded from fiction. Theoretically,
painting and sculpture are equal in respect of
the production of human beauty, for there is no form
designed by the one which may not be presented by
the other; but practically the painter cannot attain
to the height of the sculptor in the representation of
ideal beauty.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>The sculptor and painter are at a disadvantage
compared with the poet and novelist, for the limitation
of their arts compels them to confine their
imaginations to structural work. Each of the Associated
Arts consists nominally of three parts: (<i>a</i>) the
scheme, or idea, or fable; (<i>b</i>) the design or invention<a name="Eanchor_32" id="Eanchor_32"></a><a href="#Enote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>;
(<i>c</i>) the execution. In a representation of action, the
painter or sculptor can only depict a particular moment
of it, neither the beginning nor the end being
visible. He must therefore choose an action of which
the beginning and end are known, for while either
may be suggested in a simple design, both cannot be
implied so that the whole story is obvious. He has
consequently to take his moment of action from a
fact or fable in one of the literary arts, or from actual
life experience.<a name="Eanchor_33" id="Eanchor_33"></a><a href="#Enote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Where no particular action is
indicated, as in many pastoral and interior scenes
in painting, or ornamental figures in sculpture, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
conception and invention are one. Thus, the painter
or sculptor is confined to only two parts of his art,
the design and execution. While therefore the scope
of the poet and novelist is as unlimited as the sea of
human motives and passions, that of the painter and
sculptor is held within strictly marked bounds.</p>

<p>All the Associated Arts are alike in that they cannot
be specially used for moral or social purposes
without suffering a marked deterioration. This is
because of the limitations imposed upon the artist.
His wings are clipped: his imagination is confined
within a narrow groove: he is converted from a
master to a slave. Hence no great work of one of
these arts has been produced where the conception
of the artist was bound by the necessity of pointing a
moral, or of conforming to some idea of utility.<a name="Eanchor_34" id="Eanchor_34"></a><a href="#Enote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<h3>DEGREES OF BEAUTY IN THE PAINTER'S ART</h3>


<p>The degrees of beauty which the art of the painter
can exhibit appear to be, in order of their value, as
follows:</p>

<p>1. That which appeals to the senses with form,
and to the mind with expression, above the possibility
of life experience. This double beauty can
only be found in ideals, and the real cannot be associated
with it except as accessory. The highest art
of the painter is therefore confined to sacred, mythological,
and symbolical subjects.</p>

<p>2. That which appeals to the senses through representation
of the human form, without, or with
only partial idealization, and to the mind through the
indication in expression of high abstract qualities.
This section comprises subjects of profane history,
and high class portraiture. It varies from the succeeding
section in that the artist may represent the
human being as he ought to be, or would be with the
higher physical and abstract qualities emphasized, or
in certain cases, with these qualities added.</p>

<p>3. That which appeals to the senses through the
harmony of tone and design, and to the mind through
the representation of human action within the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>pass
of life experience. This section comprises interiors
and exteriors relating to daily life and labour,
and portraiture which is merely accurate imitation of
features. It differs from the previous section in that
it represents the human being as he is, and not as he
ought to be.</p>

<p>4. That which appeals to the senses through
harmony of colour and design, in respect of the imitation
and the things imitated, in addition to pleasing
because it excites admiration of the skill in imitation.
This section comprises landscape, flowers, fine
plumaged birds, and certain symmetrical animal
forms.</p>

<p>5. That which appeals to the senses through
harmony of tone and design, and indirectly to the
mind through association of ideas connected with
the other arts; in addition to pleasing because of
the excellent imitation, and possibly because of the
beauty of the things imitated. This section comprises
paintings of things connected with the other
arts, and which are neither beautiful nor displeasing,
such as books and musical instruments; or which
are imitations of products of another art, as plate,
marble reliefs, or architectural forms.</p>

<p>6. That which appeals to the senses through
harmony of tone and design, in addition to pleasing
because of the excellent imitation. This class of
beauty comprises paintings of objects which in themselves
are not beautiful, as vegetables, kitchen utensils,
and certain animals; or which are even repellent,
as dead animals.</p>

<p>7. That which appeals to the senses through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
harmony of colour, the design having no beauty in
itself. This form of art, which is the lowest in the
scale of the painter, is only adapted for the simplest
formal decoration.</p>

<p>The first three sections may produce both sensorial
and intellectual beauty; the others only sensorial.
Limited abstract qualities are associated with certain
animals in nature, but cannot be indicated in the
uncombined art of the painter.</p>

<p>Beyond these sections, there are classes of pictures
which do not belong to the pure art of the painter,
namely, those executed for use and not for beauty<a name="Eanchor_35" id="Eanchor_35"></a><a href="#Enote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>;
those painted to illustrate sports, or to record passing
events; certain allegorical paintings; and those works
which, while they cannot represent the ideal, require
the assistance of another art for their interpretation;
as for instance, incidents to illustrate particular
morals or stories; scenes from the drama other than
tragedy; portraits of persons in character; humorous
subjects, and so on. Such works, on account of the
restrictions imposed on the artist, can exhibit but
limited and fleeting beauty. Elsewhere they are
noticed under the heading of "Secondary Art."</p>

<h3>EXPRESSION. PART I.&mdash;THE IDEAL</h3>


<p>The human being is the only sign in the arts capable
of idealization, because, while its parts are fixed
and invariable, it is the only sign as to which there is
a universal agreement in respect of the value of
abstract qualities connected with it. There can be
no ideal of the human form separately, because this
implies expression which results from abstract qualities.
Nor can there be an ideal combination of these
qualities, except a general expression covering all the
virtues and eliminating all the passions, which expression
cannot be disassociated from form. The
ideal human being is therefore a perfect generalization
of the highest conceivable qualities of form and
expression.</p>

<p>Necessarily in matters of art, when we use the
term "Ideal," we mean a general ideal, that is to say,
an ideal that would be accepted as such by the general
body of men and women. From the fact that
the sensorial nerves in all persons are alike in form
and character, and that they act in the same way
under like conditions, it follows that there must be a
general agreement as to degrees of beauty, and thus a
common conception of the ideal human being. Ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>perience
has demonstrated this at all times, both in
respect of the general ideal we are now discussing,
and of particular ideals involving special types and
characters; and so invariable is this experience that
the progression towards similar ideals has all the
force of law.<a name="Eanchor_36" id="Eanchor_36"></a><a href="#Enote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> This general agreement is subject to
certain restrictions. The first is in regard to form
in which the imagination cannot proceed beyond
experience. The component parts of an ideal form
cannot include any which are higher in quality than
those which have come within the experience of the
person compounding the ideal. Secondly, in regard
to abstract qualities, the estimation of these depends
upon intelligence and education, and the accumulated
experience of these things, which we measure in
terms of degrees of civilization. Consequently,
different interpretations would be placed upon the
phrase "the highest conceivable qualities of form
and expression," by the various races of mankind.
According as the experience was greater, so would the
ideal form be higher in type; and as the civilization
was more advanced, so would the abstract qualities
exhibited be more perfect in character. But among
civilized peoples what is, within our understanding,
the ultimate form of the ideal, would not change in
respect of abstract qualities, and as to form would
only vary in comparatively insignificant details with
the width of experience.</p>

<p>It is obvious that there can be only one general
ideal covering perfection of form and mind, and this
being beyond human experience, can only be associated
with a spiritual personage, and necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
with the highest conceivable spiritual personage&mdash;the
Supreme Being. In its absolute perfection it
may be significant of the Supreme Being of any
religion of civilized peoples, but not of other spiritual
personages to whom such perfection may also be
attributed, because absolute power can only be implied
in one such personage. This power cannot be
indicated in an ideal expression, and hence there is
no alternative but to leave the one general ideal to
the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>There are only two religions in which an ideal
human form has been used in art to typify the
Supreme Being, and these are the ancient Grecian
and the Christian; but the one general ideal referred
to has only been used by the Greeks. The Christian
conception of the Deity is far nobler than that which
the Greeks had of Zeus, but in art nothing greater
than the Grecian ideal has been executed. As a type
of an Almighty Power the best Christian representation
is distinctly inferior, and it must necessarily be
so because convention requires that a particular
feature of expression must be indicated therein which
is not compulsory in the Grecian ideal. Forgiveness
of sins is a cardinal principle in the Christian doctrine,
and consequently whatever the character of
expression given to the Deity, a certain gentleness
has to be exhibited which materially limits the comprehensive
nature of the expression. The Grecian
ideal, as sculptured, strictly denied any particular
characteristic, while covering every good quality,
and hence for the Christian it is not so suitable as
the accepted modification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Greeks, ideal types of the gods and
goddesses other than Zeus varied considerably.
Those representations that have come down to us
are usually deviations from the Zeus type with certain
special characteristics, though often they can
only be distinguished from each other by symbols.
They are above human life and so cannot be appropriately
associated with human surroundings. Ideals
appertaining to Christianity are practically fixed by
convention, or are interchangeable with ideals in
allegorical and symbolical art.</p>

<p>Art is not concerned with what are termed ideal
physical qualities because beauty is its first consideration.
A form with powerful limbs and muscles
may be generally accepted as an ideal form of
strength, but these very limbs and muscles would
detract from the beauty of the figure, and so separately
such a form would be inferior art.</p>

<p>An ideal can only be applied to excellence. In
art, moral or physical deformity cannot be exaggerated
for the purpose of emphasis or contrast without
lessening the deformity or injuring the art. In
the work of the greater artists the former result
follows; in that of less skilful artists, the latter.
Homer could not deal with evil characters without
exciting a certain sympathy with them, thus diminishing
the deformity in the minds of his readers.
There is a measure of nobility about Shakespeare's
bad men, and Milton distinctly ennobled Satan in
portraying his evil powers and influence. In painting
and sculpture there is no place for hideous forms of
any description, for they either revolt the imagina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tion
and so neutralize the appreciation of the beautiful
figures present in the composition, or they verge
upon the ridiculous and disturb the mind with counteracting
influences. With rare exceptions the
greater artists have not failed to recognize this truth,<a name="Eanchor_37" id="Eanchor_37"></a><a href="#Enote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
and in respect of the very greatest men, no really
hideous figure is to be found in any of their works, if
we except certain instances where the artist had to
comply with fixed rules and conditions, as for example
in Michelangelo's Last Judgment where evil beings
had perforce to be presented, and could only be
shown as deformities.</p>

<p>Attempts to emphasize ugliness by artists of inferior
rank result in the fantastic or the ludicrous,
as in the representation of evil spirits on the old
Etruscan tombs, and the whimsical imps of the
Breughels and the younger Teniers.</p>

<h3>EXPRESSION. PART II.&mdash;CHRISTIAN IDEALS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">The Deity&mdash;Christ&mdash;The Madonna&mdash;The Madonna and Child.</p>


<p>In considering the scope for the exhibition of ideals
in art, it should be remembered that ideal types of
some of the principal personages in religious and
mythological history have been already fixed by
great artists, and it is impossible to depart from them
without producing what would appear to be abnormal
representations. Homer led the way with occasional
hints of the presumed physical appearance of
some of the leading deities of Greece, and except in
the case of Aphrodite the later Grecian sculptors
closely followed him. The Zeus of Homer as improved
by Phidias has been the model of this deity
in respect of form for nearly every succeeding sculptor
to this day, while it was also the model which
suggested the Christian Father as represented by the
first artists of the Renaissance, though, as already
indicated, the majestic dignity of the Phidian Zeus
was partly sacrificed by the Christian artists. Phidias
in fact created a type which, so far as human
foresight can judge, must ever guide the artistic
mind, whether portraying the mighty son of Kronos,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
or the God of the Christians. Only very rarely nowadays
is the Christian Deity pictured in art, and as
time goes on His introduction in human shape in a
painting will become still more rare in conformity
with changing religious ideas and practices; but now
and hereafter any artist who contemplates the representation,
must, voluntarily or involuntarily, turn
to the frescoes of Raphael and Michelangelo for his
guide.</p>

</div>


<p>There is no tradition upon which to base an actual
portrait of Christ. For the first four centuries <small>A.D.</small>,
when He was represented in art, it was usually by
means of symbols, or as a young man without beard,
but there are some Roman relics of the fifth century
remaining in which He is depicted much in the later
generally accepted type, with short beard and flowing
hair. During the long centuries of the Dark Age,
when religious art was practically confined to the
Byzantine Greeks, Christ was almost invariably
portrayed with a long face and emaciated features
and limbs, as the epitome of sadness and sorrow.
This expression was modified as the arts travelled to
the north and west of Europe, and gradually His
face began to assume more regularity and beauty.
Then came Cimabue to sow the seed of the Renaissance,
and with him the ideal of Christ was changed
to a perfect man of flesh and blood. A century or
more was occupied in establishing this ideal, but it
was so established, and has maintained its position
to this day.<a name="Eanchor_38" id="Eanchor_38"></a><a href="#Enote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>This ideal represents the Saviour as a man of about
thirty-three years&mdash;His age at the Crucifixion. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>wears flowing hair with a short beard and usually a
moustache. His face is rather long, often oval; the
features have a perfect regularity, and the expression
is commonly one of patient resignation. Naturally
His body must appear well nourished, otherwise
corporeal beauty cannot be expressed. This is the
type which has been used since the height of the
Renaissance, though there have been a few exceptional
representations. Thus, the face of Christ in
Lionardo's Last Supper at Milan is that of a beardless
young man of some twenty-five years<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> and
Raphael in an early picture shows Him beardless, but
gives Him an age of about thirty.<a name="FNanchor_B_6" id="FNanchor_B_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_6" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Some early
Flemish artists also rendered Him beardless at times,
notably the Maitre de Fl&eacute;malle, Van der Weyden, and
Quentin Matsys. Michelangelo in his Last Judgment
represents the Saviour sitting in judgment as a robust,
stern, commanding figure, beardless, and with an
expression and bearing apparently serving the idea
of Justice.<a name="FNanchor_C_7" id="FNanchor_C_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_7" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Strange to say the artist gives a very
similar face to St. Stephen in the same series of
frescoes. A still more unusual representation is that
of Francisco di Giorgio, who gives Christ the appearance
of an Apollo,<a name="FNanchor_D_8" id="FNanchor_D_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_8" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> while Bramantino depicts His
face worn with heavy lines.<a name="FNanchor_E_9" id="FNanchor_E_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_9" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> In one picture Marco
Basaiti shows Him as a young man with long hair
but without beard, and in another with a thick beard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
without moustache.<a name="FNanchor_F_10" id="FNanchor_F_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_10" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> There was considerable variation
in the type among the Venetians of the sixteenth
century, but not in important features, and since then
very few artists indeed have ventured to depart from
the ideal above described. The only notable exception
in recent times is in a work by Burne-Jones who
represents Christ as a beardless youth, though indicating
the wound to St. Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_G_11" id="FNanchor_G_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_11" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> It is supposed
that the artist presumed that the Person of Christ
underwent a complete change after the Resurrection.</p>


<p>It is evident that the ideal Christ as established
by the Italians can scarcely be improved upon in art
within the prescribed limitations. Christ having
lived as an actual man, His representation must be
within the bounds of possible experience; and since
He died at the age of thirty-three, intellectual power
cannot be suggested in His countenance, for this in
life means an expression implying large experience
warranted only by mature age. The representation is
therefore confined to that of a man who, while exhibiting
a healthy regularity of form and feature, has
lost all sense of earthly pleasure. The beauty
achieved by this type is negative, the only marked
quality being a suggestion of sadness which, in painting,
is necessarily present in all expression where an
unconcern with human instincts and passions is depicted.
The Italians in their representation of Christ
were thus unable to reach the height of the Greek
divine portrayals. They were confined to earth, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the Greek figures were symbols of spiritual forms
which were pure products of the imagination.
Giotto and his successors sought a physically perfect
man with all purely human features in expression
eliminated. The Greeks, even when representing
divinities below Zeus, generalized all human attributes,
excluding nothing but the exceptional. They
embodied in their forms, truths acknowledged by the
whole world; summed up human life to the contentment
of all men: there was nothing in their divinities
which would prevent their acceptance as spiritual
symbols in all religions of civilized peoples. To them
human instincts were sacred: all human passions
could be ennobled: everything in the natural progression
of life came within the purview, and under
the protection, of the gods. So the course of their
art was definite: there was never a difference as to
the goal, for it was universal.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the development of art
the ideal Christ has been of little importance compared
with the ideal Madonna, though here also the
Italians aimed for a particular instead of a general
type. They wanted a living woman with the form
and features of a pulsating mother; a woman of
ordinary life in fact, but infinitely superior in physical
beauty, and endowed with the highest grace that
their imaginations could conceive and their hands
execute. This ideal seemed to germinate with Cimabue,
but an immense advance upon him was made
by Giotto who was unsurpassed in the representation
of the Holy Mother for more than a century. But
the ideal was yet purely formal and continued so till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
past the middle of the fifteenth century, both in
Italy and Flanders. Giotto was then excelled by
many artists, but the Madonnas they produced,
though often very beautiful, are not humanly attractive.
They are on the side of the Angels; have never
been women evidently, and are far, far away from
the human type with tingling veins and heaving
breath. Filippo Lippi marked the border line between
this type of Madonna, and the advanced
pattern produced by the series of great artists of the
latter part of the fifteenth century. But with Lionardo,
Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, and the rest, the
Madonna was scarcely an ideal woman. Living
persons were commonly taken as models, and although
the portraits were no doubt "improved,"
they have little connection with the ideal which the
artists evidently had in mind. The very life which
the artist transfers to canvas in a portrait is destructive
of the ideal, for it is a particular life with evidence
of particular emotions and passions from which
the Madonna should be free.</p>

<p>A mighty barrier must be passed before a woman
is translated on canvas into the type of Madonna
sought by the first Renaissance artists. She must
be a woman of the earth; a woman who has grown
up amidst human surroundings from infancy to girlhood,
and from girlhood to womanhood; with human
aspirations and sympathies, and experience of joys
and trials: she must have all these, and as well have
become a mother; and yet with human beauty, her
countenance must be such that by no stretch of the
imagination can the possibility of desire be suggested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
This was the problem, and certainly only a genius of
the highest order could arrive at a solution, for the
task appears on the face of it to be almost superhuman.
But Raphael succeeded in accomplishing
it, and his achievement will stand for all time as one
of the greatest epoch-making events in history.
Even Michelangelo, who created so many superb
forms, never succeeded with an ideal suitable for a
Madonna.<a name="Eanchor_39" id="Eanchor_39"></a><a href="#Enote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>It is clear that in reaching for his ideal, Raphael
did not strive for an expression relating to the spiritual.
His purpose was to eliminate from the features
anything which might possibly be construed as indicating
earthly desires, and yet retain the highest
conceivable human beauty. With this double object
contentment is a quality in expression which is indispensable,
and this Raphael was careful to give,
sometimes emphasizing it with a suggestion of happiness.
It is not possible to go further with an expression
which is to generalize the highest human physical
and abstract qualities, while keeping the figure
within the range of apparent feasible realization in
life. The result was ideal but not exclusive. It is a
universal type, and is suited to the Madonna because
there is nothing humanly higher within our comprehension;
but it has a further general import which
is dealt with elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although the aim achieved by Raphael must
necessarily be the goal of all artists in the representation
of the Madonna, it is of course not essential
that he should be accepted as the only guide to her
form. Her features may vary indefinitely so long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the ideal is maintained, and Raphael himself painted
no two Madonnas with the same features. But certain
traditions must be observed, however much one
may depart from the actual circumstances of her
life. The first is in respect of her presumed age. In
pictures dealing with her life soon after marriage,
as for instance, the Nativity and the Flight into
Egypt, the Madonna is invariably represented as
many years older than she appears in Annunciation
subjects, though only a year or so actually passed
between the respective events. The reason for this is
obvious. She must be shown with the bloom of a
matured woman. The highest form of nobility cannot
be disassociated from wisdom and experience,
which could not be indicated in the countenance of
a girl in her teens. Innocence and purity may be
present, and a certain majesty even, but our conception
of the Madonna as a woman involves the
triumph over known evils, the full knowledge of
right and wrong, and the consciousness of a supreme
position above the possibility of sin. Hence in all
representations of the Madonna at the Nativity and
afterwards, she must be shown at an age suggesting
the fullest knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p>While, between the Annunciation and incidents
occurring during the infancy of Christ, many years
must be presumed to have passed, from this latter
period on, the Madonna must be supposed to have
aged very little, if at all, right up to the Crucifixion.
It is not often that we find her included in a design
illustrating the life of Christ between His infancy and
the Death Scene, a fact probably due to the age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
difficulty. In the exceptions her face is often partly
or wholly hidden. But in scenes of the Crucifixion,
where the Virgin is almost invariably introduced,
artists of all periods, with few exceptions, have been
careful to avoid suggesting the full presumed age.
Commonly the age indicated is between twenty-five
and thirty years, but as the face is always pale, and
often somewhat drawn, her comparatively youthful
appearance is not conspicuous. Obviously under no
circumstances should lines be present in the features,
for this would suggest a physical decay not in conformity
with Christian ideas.<a name="Eanchor_40" id="Eanchor_40"></a><a href="#Enote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Even in pictures
relating to her death, which is presumed to have
occurred at an age between fifty and sixty years, her
face is shown with perfectly regular and smooth
features, though an extreme pallor may be painted.
But from the point of view of art, the Virgin must
be regarded as an accessory in works relating to
the Crucifixion, for to throw her into prominence
would result in dividing the attention of the observer
of the picture on first inspection, and so
lessening the art. In any case she must be painted
with an expression of grief, and hence an unalloyed
ideal of transcendent beauty is out of the
question.</p>

<p>The custom of representing the Madonna in costume
and surroundings indicating a higher social
level than that in which she actually moved, is now
firmly established, and cannot be departed from
without lowering the ideal. A woman in a lowly
position of life, who is compelled to bear all the responsibilities
of a home, with the care of a husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and child, is seldom seen except in the performance of
household duties. We cannot see her without associating
her in our minds with toil and possible privation,
and we naturally expect that the effect of these
will be indicated in her expression and general bearing.
If away from her home her costume would
usually declare her position, while habits of mind
connected with her daily occupation commonly engender
mannerisms in air and gait which support the
inference drawn from the character of her attire. It
would appear anomalous to paint a woman so situated
with such beauty of form and expression that
she appears to have never experienced earthly cares
of any kind, much less the long repeated daily worries
consequent upon the charge of a poor household.
Perfect beauty of form being essential in the representation
of the Madonna, she must be painted
amidst surroundings conformable with the supposition
that she is free from earthly responsibilities,
and that her mind is entirely occupied
with the boundless joy and happiness arising from
the contemplation of the divine Mission of her
Son.<a name="Eanchor_41" id="Eanchor_41"></a><a href="#Enote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The difficulty in painting the Madonna is complicated
when the Infant Christ is introduced, because
of the liability of the Child to interfere with a
fine presentation of her figure. A similar problem
was met with by the early Greeks, and doubtless
they dealt with it in their paintings as in their sculptures,
a few of which, showing an adult holding a
child, have come down to us. These represent the
child reduced in size as far as possible, and carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
at the side of the adult figure.<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> A like system was
followed by most of the Byzantine workers, and it is
very noticeable in some of the fine French sculpture
of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_B_13" id="FNanchor_B_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_13" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> In the same period
Giovanni Pisano in sculpture,<a name="FNanchor_C_14" id="FNanchor_C_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_14" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> and Cimabue in
painting,<a name="FNanchor_D_15" id="FNanchor_D_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_15" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> maintained the tradition in Italy, and
in the century following, Giotto,<a name="FNanchor_E_16" id="FNanchor_E_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_16" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>
Duccio,<a name="FNanchor_F_17" id="FNanchor_F_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_17" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Lorenzetto,<a name="FNanchor_G_18" id="FNanchor_G_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_18" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
and others, often adopted the plan. Towards
the middle of the fifteenth century, the relative importance
attached to the Child in the group generally
increased, and by the end of it, the old practice
had been almost entirely abandoned. Meanwhile the
artists had some hard problems to meet. The first
was as to the size of the Child. It appeared to be
generally agreed that an older Child should be represented
than had been the custom, though a few
artists held back, notably Fra Angelico, while in
sculpture, Donatello maintained his habit of moulding
the Child as only a few weeks old. With an increased
age of the Child, the difficulty of securing
repose for the group was enhanced, for it seemed to be
proper with a child past its infancy, that it should be
pictured as engaged in one of the charming simple
actions common to childhood. These questions were
settled in different ways according to the genius and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
temperament of the artists. A few of them, as Mantegna,<a name="FNanchor_H_19" id="FNanchor_H_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_19" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Lorenzo Costa,<a name="FNanchor_I_20" id="FNanchor_I_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_20" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
and Montagna,<a name="FNanchor_J_21" id="FNanchor_J_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_21" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> gave the
Child an age of two years or more, and in some of
their designs the figures seem to be of equal significance,
Mantegna and Montagna in several examples
actually standing the Child in the Virgin's lap with
the heads touching each other.</p>

</div>

<p>The plans usually adopted by the greatest masters,
were, to present the maximum repose with the Child
sitting in the lap of the Virgin; or to place Him apart
from her, and engaged in some slight action; or to
show Him in the arms of the Virgin, either held at
the side, or in front, with the Virgin more or less in
profile. In all of these schemes the serene contemplation
of the Holy Mother is practically undisturbed.
In his many groups of the Virgin and Child, and of
the Holy Family, Raphael only varied twice from
these plans,<a name="FNanchor_A_22" id="FNanchor_A_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_22" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> and in both the exceptions the Child
reclines across the lap of the Virgin, so that very
little of her figure is hidden. Titian has the Child
standing by her side,<a name="FNanchor_B_23" id="FNanchor_B_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_23" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> or held away from her, and
in one example the Virgin is placing Him in the hands
of St. Joseph.<a name="FNanchor_C_24" id="FNanchor_C_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_24" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> Correggio, when away from the
influence of Mantegna, usually showed the Child
held apart from the Mother, or placed on the floor,
or on a bench. It is a common device to show the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Child on the lap of the Virgin, but leaning over to
take a flower or other object offered Him,<a name="FNanchor_D_25" id="FNanchor_D_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_25" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> and numerous
artists allow Him to play around separately.<a name="FNanchor_E_26" id="FNanchor_E_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_26" class="fnanchor">[v]</a>
In Holbein's fine group at Augsburg, the Child stands
between the Virgin and St. Anne, and another German
painter shows Him held up by the same personages,
but clear from both of them.<a name="FNanchor_F_27" id="FNanchor_F_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_27" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> Murillo
commonly stands the Child at the side of the Virgin,
but in one picture adopts the novel method of placing
Him in the arms of St. Joseph.<a name="FNanchor_G_28" id="FNanchor_G_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_28" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>When the Child is shown distinctly apart from the
Virgin, or leaning away from her lap, great care is
necessary in avoiding strength in the action, otherwise
it will draw attention away from the Virgin. A
notable example of this defect is in a picture by Parmigiano,
where the Child leans over and has his head
brought close to that of a kneeling Saint who is
caressing Him, the effect being most disturbing.<a name="FNanchor_A_29" id="FNanchor_A_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_29" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Bramantino shows the Child in an extraordinary
attitude, for He holds His head above His arms
without any apparent reason, the action confusing
the design.<a name="FNanchor_B_30" id="FNanchor_B_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_30" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> Many artists represent Him in the act
of reaching out his hand for flowers, without choosing
for the moment of portrayal, an instant of transition
from one part of the action to another,<a name="FNanchor_C_31" id="FNanchor_C_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_31" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a> a point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>rarely overlooked by the first masters.<a name="FNanchor_D_32" id="FNanchor_D_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_32" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a> Occasionally
variety is given in the introduction of nursery
duties, as for instance, washing the Child,<a name="FNanchor_E_33" id="FNanchor_E_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_33" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a> but these
are inappropriate for reasons already indicated, apart
from the over strong action necessarily exhibited in
such designs. Nor should the Child have an unusual
expression, as this will immediately catch the eye of
the observer. In one work Del Sarto actually makes
Him laugh,<a name="FNanchor_F_34" id="FNanchor_F_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_34" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a> and a modern artist gives Him an
expression of fear.<a name="FNanchor_G_35" id="FNanchor_G_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_35" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a> It is questionable whether
Masaccio<a name="FNanchor_H_36" id="FNanchor_H_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_36" class="fnanchor">[af]</a> and others (including A. della Robbia
and Rossellino in sculpture) did not go too far in
portraying the Child with a finger in its mouth, for
although such an incident is common with children,
in this case it seems opposed to propriety. Generally
the first artists have striven to free the figure of the
Virgin as far as possible, and this is in conformity
with first principles, for it simplifies the view of the
chief figure in the composition. In all cases repose
should be the keynote of the design.</p>

<p>There are no general ideals in Christian art other
than those mentioned. The presumed occupants of
the Celestial regions beyond these Personages, are
painted as the fancy of the artist may dictate, subject
only to the limitations of the accepted Christian
doctrines. There are certain conventions in respect
of Angels and Saints, but they are by no means strict;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>and for the Old Testament prophets, Michelangelo's
work in the Sistine Chapel is commonly taken as a
guide. It is scarcely likely that his examples will ever
be exceeded in majestic beauty.</p>

<h3>EXPRESSION. PART III.&mdash;CLASSICAL IDEALS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Ideals of the Greeks&mdash;Aphrodite&mdash;Hera&mdash;Demeter&mdash;Athena&mdash;Apollo&mdash;Diana&mdash;Neptune&mdash;Mars&mdash;Mercury&mdash;Bacchus&mdash;Vulcan&mdash;General
classical compositions.</p>


<p>What human being can appropriately describe
the great ideals in art of ancient Greece? Above us
all they stand, seemingly as upon the pinnacle of the
universal mind, reflecting the collective human
soul, and exhibiting the concentrated essence of
human nature. The best of men and women of all
ages is combined in these ideal heads, which look
from an endless past to an eternal future; which
embody every passion and every virtue; every religion
and every philosophy; all wisdom and all
knowledge. They are ideal gods and goddesses,
but are independent of legends and history. They
represent no mythological deities except in name,
and least of all do they assort with the deities of
Homer and Hesiod. In all other religions the ideals
expressed in art fail entirely to reach the height of
the general conceptions, and are far below the spiritual
beings as depicted in the sacred books; but
the Grecian ideals as recorded in stone are so far
beyond the legendary gods of the ancient poets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
that we are unable to pass from the stone to the
literature without an overwhelming feeling of astonishment
at the contrast. It is unfortunate that we
are powerless to re-establish these ideals definitely,
for the originals have been mostly lost; nevertheless
the ancient copies, a few contemporary complete
sculptures, and many glorious fragments; as well as
intimate descriptions and repeated eulogies, often
reaching to hyperbole, of eminent men, expressed
over a succession of centuries when the great works
were still exposed to view&mdash;all this assembled evidence
indelibly stamps upon our minds the nature
of the ideals; gives us a clear impression of the most
profound conceptions that have emanated from the
human brain.</p>

<p>The people who accomplished these great monuments
seem to have thought only in terms of the
universe. They did not seek for the embodiment
of goodness, nobility, and charity, perfection in
which qualities we regard as divine, but they aimed
at a majesty which included all these things; which
comprehended nothing but the supreme in form and
mind; and with an all-reaching knowledge of the
human race, stood outside of it, but covered it with
reflected glory, as the sun stands ever away from
the planets but illumines them all. The wonder is
not that these ideals were created in the minds of
the Greeks, for there is no boundary to the imagination,
but that minds could be found to set them
down in design, and hands to mould and shape them
in clay and stone; and that many minds and hands
could do these things in the same epoch. That these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sculptured forms have never been equalled is not
wonderful; that they never will be surpassed is as
certain as that death is the penalty of life. So
firmly have they become grafted into the minds of
men as things unapproachable in beauty, that they
have themselves been converted into general ideals
towards which all must climb who attempt to scale
the heights of art. The greatest artists known to
us since the light of Greek intelligence flickered
away, have been content to study these marble
remains, and to cull from them a suggestion here,
and an idea there, with which to adorn their own
creations. Indeed it is clear that from the time of
Niccolo Pisano, who leaped at one bound to celebrity
after studying the antique sculptures at Pisa,
through Giotto to the fifteenth and sixteenth century
giants, there was hardly a great artist who was not
more or less dependent upon Grecian art for his
skill, and the most enduring of them all&mdash;Donatello,
Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Correggio&mdash;were
the most deeply versed in the art.<a name="Eanchor_42" id="Eanchor_42"></a><a href="#Enote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Bellori affirmed that the Roman school, of which
Raphael and Michelangelo were the greatest masters,
derived its principles from the study of the statues
and other works of the ancients.<a name="FNanchor_A_37" id="FNanchor_A_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_37" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> This is not strictly
exact, but it is near the truth, and certain it is that
Michelangelo, the first sculptor known to the world
since the Dark Age, willingly bowed his head before
the ancient triumphs of art presented to his view.
And yet he did not see the Parthenon sculptures
and other numerous works of the time of Phidias,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
with the many beautiful examples of the next century
which have been made available since his day.
What he would have said in the presence of the
glories of the Parthenon, with the Hermes of Praxiteles
and the rest of the collection from Olympia,
is hard to conjecture, though it may well be suggested
that they would have prompted him to still
higher work than any he accomplished. With these
stupendous ideals in front of us, it seems almost
unnecessary to talk of the principles of art. Their
very perfection indicates that they were built up
on eternal principles, so that in fact and in theory
they form the surest guide for the sculptor and
painter.</p>

<p>But how is the painter to use these ancient gods
and goddesses, for the time has gone by to gather
them together on the heights of Olympus, or to
associate them with human frailties? Surely he
may leave aside the fables of the poets, and try to
portray the deities as the Grecian populace saw them
in their hearts&mdash;noble forms of adoration, or images
of terror, objects of curses veneered with prayer
and of offerings wrapped in fear. The artist has
not now to be troubled with pangs of dread, nor will
his imagination be limited by sacerdotal scruples.
The rivalry of Praxiteles need not concern him, for
there are wondrous ideals yet to be wrought, which
will be comprehended and loved even in these days
of hastening endeavour. But the painter must
leave alone the Zeus and the variation of this god
in the pictured Christian Deity, for the type is so
firmly established in the minds of men that it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
be useless to depart from it. The other important
Grecian deities with which art is concerned may be
shortly considered from the point of view of the
painter, though they are naturally of far more importance
to the sculptor because it is beyond the
power of the painter to suggest an illusion of divine
form, since he must associate his figures with human
accessories.<a name="Eanchor_43" id="Eanchor_43"></a><a href="#Enote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>


<h4><br />APHRODITE</h4>

<p>Astarte, Aphrodite, Venus, Spirit of Love, or by
whatever name we call her; the one eternal divinity
recognized by all ages, all races; the universal essence
whose fragrance intoxicates every soul: the
one queen before whom all must bow: the one imperial
autocrat sure of everlasting rule&mdash;sure of the
devoted allegiance of every living thing to the end
of time! Such is Aphrodite, for that is the name
under which we seem to love her best&mdash;the Aphrodite
of the Greeks, without the vague terrifying
aspect of Astarte, or the more earthly qualities of
the Roman Venus. Who loves not the Aphrodite
sprung from the foam of the sea; shading the sun
on the Cytheran isle with the light of her glory;
casting an eternal hallow over the groves of Cyprus;
flooding the god-like mind of Greece with her sparkling
radiance? What conception of her beauty can
rise high enough when the grass in astonishment
grows beneath her feet on desert rocks; when lions
and tigers gently purr as she passes, and the rose
and the myrtle throw out their scented blossoms to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
sweeten the air? Hera and Athena leave the heavens
to help man fight and kill: Aphrodite descends
to soothe despairing hearts, and kindle kindly flame
in the breast of the loveless. The spear and the
shield with the crested helmet she knows not, nor
the fiery coursers accustomed to the din of strife.
Serenely she traverses space at the call of a lover's
prayer, her car a bower of celestial blooms. From
the ends of the earth fly the sparrows to draw it,
till their myriads hide the sun, and mortals learn
that the time has come when their thoughts may
turn to the spirit of love.</p>

<p>This was the Aphrodite of Grecian legend and
poetry, if we except Homer and Hesiod. It is the
type of the goddess whom Sappho implored, and
must be accepted as the general ideal of the Grecian
worshippers who desired divine mediation when
troubled with pangs of the heart. But it was not
the type of Phidias and his school, for Phidias passed
over Hesiod and purified Homer, representing
Aphrodite with the stately mien and lofty bearing
of a queen of heaven, daughter of the all-powerful
Dione: goddess of beauty and love certainly, but
so far above the human understanding of these terms
that all efforts to associate her with mundane ideas
and aspirations must signally fail.<a name="Eanchor_44" id="Eanchor_44"></a><a href="#Enote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>So far as we know it was Praxiteles who first attempted
to realize in stone the popular ideal of the
goddess, and certainly the Cnidian Aphrodite was
better understood by the people of Greece as a type
of this ideal than any work that preceded it. We
can attach to it in our minds but very few of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Homeric and other legends surrounding the history
of the goddess, but we can well imagine that a deity
who was the subject of so much attention and so
much prayer, could rest in the hearts of the people
only as one with every supreme earthly charm,
combined with a divine bearing and dignity. These
qualities the Aphrodite of Praxiteles appears to
have possessed, though it lacked the majesty and
exclusiveness of the Parthenon gods.<a name="Eanchor_45" id="Eanchor_45"></a><a href="#Enote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Thus there was formed a type of beauty acceptable
to the average human mind as an unsurpassable
representation of an ideal woman: to the worshipper
at the ancient shrines, a comprehensible goddess;
to all other men the personification of sublime
beauty. The fifth century goddess was left aside
as beyond mortal reach, and from the time it left
the sculptor's hands to this day, the Cnidian Venus
has been regarded as a model for all that is true
and beautiful in women. To the sculptor it is an
everlasting beacon; to all men a crowning glory of
human handiwork. And this notwithstanding that
so far as we know, the original figure has long been
lost, and we have preserved little more than records
of its renown, a fair copy of it, and a single authentic
example of the other work of the sculptor. But if
we had the actual Aphrodite before us, it could not
occupy a higher place in our minds than the goddess
which our imagination builds upon this framework.</p>

<p>As in all cases where a supreme artist rises above
his fellows and creates works of which emulation appears
hopeless, the period succeeding the time of
Praxiteles seems to mark a decline in the art of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
sculpture, and though the decline was more apparent
than real for about half a century, there was
naturally a depreciation in the representation of the
deities of whom the great man had fashioned masterpieces.
This was so in the case of Aphrodite. Whoever
the sculptor it seemed impossible to approach
the Cnidian ideal, and the result was a series of
variations stamped with artificial devices as if to
emphasize the departure. But meanwhile the painter's
art had developed upon much the same lines as
sculpture, and Apelles produced an Aphrodite, which,
considering the limitation of the painter, appears to
have been almost, if not quite, as marvellous as the
stone model of Praxiteles. Nearly two thousand
years have passed since the painting was last known
to exist, but its fame was so great that the reverberations
from the thunder of praise accorded it
have scarcely yet died away. No close description
of the painting remains, but from certain references
to it by ancient authors we know that it represented
the sea-born goddess walking towards the
shore to make her first appearance on earth, holding
in each hand a tress of hair as if in the act of wringing
out the water therein.<a name="Eanchor_46" id="Eanchor_46"></a><a href="#Enote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> These are practically
all the written details we have of the famous Venus
Anadyomene, but we really know much more of it
from the existence of certain pre-Roman sculptures.
All but one are broken, with parts missing, but the
exception, which dates from about the beginning of
the third century <small>B.C.</small>, enables us to gain a good idea
of the picture. The figure represents the goddess
with her lower limbs cut off close to the hips; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is to say, it produces the whole of that part of the
figure in the picture of Apelles which is visible above
the water.<a name="FNanchor_A_38" id="FNanchor_A_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_38" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Clearly a subject in which Venus is
shown to be walking in the sea, so foreign to the
art of the sculptor, could not have suggested itself
independently to a Grecian artist, nor would we
expect to find one attempting a work which necessitated
amputation of the lower limbs, unless a very
special occasion warranted the design. The special
occasion in this case was the picture of Apelles,
which was at the time renowned through the whole
of Greece as an extraordinary masterpiece, and with
this work in their minds the sculptured head and
torso would appear quite appropriate to those
Greeks interested in the arts, that is to say, the
entire citizen population.</p>

<p>These two works then, the Cnidian Venus and
the Venus Anadyomene of Apelles, constitute the
models upon which the world relies for its conceptions
of the goddess of beauty. Both models
depend more or less upon the imagination for completion,
but they are sufficiently definite for the
artist, who, of course, desires general rather than
particular ideas for his purpose.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the attempts to rival
Apelles in the creation of a Venus Anadyomene have
not been very successful. Raphael painted a small
picture of the subject, introducing the figure of
Time putting an end to the power of the Titans.<a name="FNanchor_B_39" id="FNanchor_B_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_39" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Venus stands in the water with one foot on a shell,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>while holding a tress of hair with her left hand. As
may be expected the execution is perfect, but the
design is less attractive than that of Apelles. The
only important work of the Renaissance directly
based upon the Greek design, is from the hand of
Titian.<a name="FNanchor_C_40" id="FNanchor_C_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_40" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> He represents the goddess walking out
of the water, the surface of which only reaches half
way up the thighs, with the result that considerably
more action is indicated than is necessary. But
the great artist was evidently at a loss to know how
to give the figure the size of life or thereabouts,
while indicating from the depth of water that she
had an appreciable distance to go before touching
dry land. He solved the problem by placing the
line of the front leg to which the water rises, at the
bottom of the canvas, so that the picture suggests
an accident which has necessitated the cutting
away of the lower portion of the work. The master
also varies the scheme of Apelles by crossing the
left hand over the breast. This inferior device was
imitated by Rubens, who, however, exhibits the
goddess rising from the water amongst a group of
nymphs and tritons.<a name="FNanchor_D_41" id="FNanchor_D_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_41" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> Modern artists in designs of
the birth of Venus, usually represent her as having
reached the shore,<a name="FNanchor_E_42" id="FNanchor_E_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_42" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> the best work of this scheme
being perhaps that of Cabanel who shows the goddess
lying at the water's edge and just awaking,
suggesting a state of unconsciousness while she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>floated on the waves.<a name="FNanchor_F_43" id="FNanchor_F_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_43" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> Another exception is by
Thoma, who exhibits the goddess walking in only
a few inches of water, reminding one of the old
Roman bronze workers who imitated the form
as painted by Apelles, but modelled the whole
figure.</p>

<p>Repose being the first compulsory quality in the
representation of Aphrodite, it is not surprising to
find that the greatest picture of the goddess extant&mdash;the
masterpiece of Giorgione&mdash;shows her asleep.<a name="FNanchor_A_44" id="FNanchor_A_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_44" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
She rests on a verdure couch in a landscape of which
the signs indicate a soft and tranquil atmosphere,
with no suggestion to disturb the repose or remove
the illusion of life so strongly marked by the skilful
drawing. Only the calm sleeping beauty is there
without appearance of fatigue or recovery from it:
no expression save of perfect dreamless unconsciousness.
The work is the nearest approach to a classical
ideal that exists in Venetian painting. Titian in
his various pictures of Venus reposing never reached
the excellence of his master. In all, he painted the
goddess in a resting position, sometimes radiant
and brilliant, and invariably with a contented expression
which precludes sensual suggestions: still
there is ever a distinctly earthy tone about the
figures. His Venuses in fact are pure portraits.
He did not seek to represent profound repose. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>most important example is at the Uffizi Gallery,<a name="FNanchor_B_45" id="FNanchor_B_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_45" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
the design of which was taken from Giorgione's
work. The goddess is a figure of glowing beauty,
but the pose indicates consciousness of this fact and
calls the model to mind. Perhaps the surroundings
tend to accentuate the drawback, for in this, as in
most of his other pictures of Venus, the artist has
introduced Venetian accessories of the period.
Palma Vecchio also took Giorgione's work as a
guide for his reposing Venus, but he represents her
fully awake with Cupid present.<a name="FNanchor_C_46" id="FNanchor_C_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_46" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> An exceptional
work of the subject was designed by Michelangelo,
and painted by Pontormo<a name="FNanchor_D_47" id="FNanchor_D_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_47" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> and others. It represents
the goddess reclining with Cupid at her head;
but the form is entirely opposed to all our conceptions
of Venus, for she is seen as a broad massive woman
with a short neck, and a strongly formed head&mdash;a
fit companion for some of the figures in the Sistine
Chapel. Proud dignity and a certain majesty are
suggested in the expression, but the figure is without
the grace and charm usually associated with the
goddess. The only other early Italian reposing
Venus of interest is Botticelli's, where he shows her
in deep thought with two cupids by her side.<a name="FNanchor_E_48" id="FNanchor_E_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_48" class="fnanchor">[l]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century Venus was rarely
represented reposing. Nicholas Poussin has a fine
picture on the subject, but unfortunately for the
repose a couple of cupids are in action beside the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>sleeping goddess, while the heads of two satyrs are
dimly seen.<a name="FNanchor_A_49" id="FNanchor_A_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_49" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> In the Sleeping Venus of Le Sueur,
which was much praised in former times, Cupid is
present with a finger to his mouth to indicate silence,
but Vulcan is seen in an adjoining room wielding
a heavy hammer, the suggestion of repose being
thus destroyed. No reposing Venus of importance
has since been produced, though a few French artists
have treated the subject in a light vein, notably
Boucher in his Sleeping Venus, and Fragonard in a
delicate composition of Venus awakened by Aurora.</p>

<p>Venus cannot be represented as conscious of her
beauty, or the design would immediately suggest
vanity. Consequently when shown looking into a
mirror, she should be engaged at her toilet, or at
least the reflection should be accidental. Titian
painted the first great picture of the goddess at her
toilet, but this is just completed and her hands are
at rest.<a name="FNanchor_B_50" id="FNanchor_B_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_50" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> The attitude would be extravagant were
it not that any suggestion of satisfaction is overcome
by the artist making Cupid hold the mirror, and
giving Venus an expression of unconcern as she
glances at her reflection. The work suggested to
Rubens a similar design, but he shows the goddess
dressing her hair, this being apparently the only
definite action which may be properly introduced
into such a composition.<a name="FNanchor_C_51" id="FNanchor_C_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_51" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> Albani has a delightful
picture in which Cupid compels Venus to hold a
mirror,<a name="FNanchor_D_52" id="FNanchor_D_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_52" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> and some later artists have represented
her adorning her tresses with the aid of a water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>reflection. The only notable <i>faux pas</i> in a painting
of this subject is in the Venus and Cupid
assigned to Velasquez, in which Venus lies on her
side and looks into a mirror held by Cupid at her
feet.<a name="FNanchor_E_53" id="FNanchor_E_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_53" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> There is no suggestion of toilet or accident,
and hence the attitude is quite inapplicable to
a goddess.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the province of
Aphrodite is to infuse the gentle warmth of love into
the human race, and not to attract love to herself.
The rays are presumed to proceed from her only,
for a mortal having no divine powers would be incapable
of reflecting them. Zeus was required to
bring about the adventure with Anchises. Hence
a voluptuous form should never be given to the
goddess, and if an artist err at all in the matter, it
should be on the side of restraint lest the art be
affected by a suggestion of the sensuous. The
surest means of preventing this is to represent the
goddess in an attitude of repose, with perfect contentment
as a feature in expression. If any action
be indicated, it must be light and purely accidental
in its nature. To introduce an action involving an
apprehension of human failings tends to bring the
goddess down to the human level, and thus to destroy
the ideal. The Venus de' Medici is a superb sculpture
of a woman, but an inferior representation of
Venus, for modesty is a human attribute arising
from purely artificial circumstances of life, its meaning
varying with race conditions and customs. To
depict a goddess in an action suggestive of modesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
or other antidote to the coarser effects of natural
instincts, is therefore an anomaly.</p>


<h4><br />HERA</h4>

<p>There is no fixed type in art of the ox-eyed sister
and spouse of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, whose
breast heaves ever high, and flaming, with the rushing
fire of jealousy; the Virgilian incarnation of bitter
rage; yet withal the symbol of eternal Earth, yearly
renewing her fruitful youth with the burning kiss
of the sun. The sculptors of Greece saw in her only
the supreme Matron-Spouse, serenely pondering
the march of time beneath the awful sway of her
lord. A mantle she wore, and a high-throated tunic,
as she looked into space from a square-wrought
throne; or she stood in her temple with flowing
robe and diadem, inscrutable, before the offerings
of an adoring multitude. But nevertheless she was
not insensible to the radiance of Aphrodite. Polyclitus
did well to place a cuckoo on her sceptre, and
who can forget how the lotus and the hyacinth cushioned
the ground on the heights of Ida beneath a
golden cloud, which held suspended around the
glittering couch a screen of sparkling dew?</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the painter is at a loss to
deal with the majestic scenes in great Juno's story.
How is he to depict her flying in the celestial chariot
between heaven and earth, each leap of the fiery
coursers measuring the range of the eye from a lofty
peak across the sea to the endless haze? How can
he paint her anointed with ambrosial oil which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
ever struggling for freedom to bathe the rolling
earth in fragrance? He may add a hundred tassels
to her girdle; perhaps give her the triple grace-showering
eardrops, and even the dazzling sun-bright
veil; but the girdle of Aphrodite, which peeps
from her bosom, will fail to turn the brains of men,
or pierce their hearts with rays of soft desire. And
the more dreadful side of Hera's history would
equally trouble the despairing artist, for dire anger
and jealousy ill-become the countenance of a goddess.
The smouldering fire must never leap into flame.
Eyes may not flash, not the lips quiver, and the
noble brow must be free from fitful thought.</p>

<p>So with Hera there is no middle course for the
painter. He must represent her alone, calm and
passionless, unfathomable, with a sublime disregard
of earth; or else join with his predecessors and drag
her down to a mundane level in scenes of trivial
fable. But there is room for untold Heras of the
higher type.</p>


<h4><br />DEMETER</h4>

<p>Matron-Guardian of the yielding soil; heart-stricken
wanderer over the earth; mysterious silent
Food-Mother whom all men love and the gods revere;
eternal life-preserver; fruitful, but passionless save
where the vision of Pluto looms, Iasus and Poseidon
notwithstanding! Such was the Demeter of the
ancient Greeks till the hordes of Alexander mingled
her fame with the lustre from Isis and De. So the
mourning <i>haute dame</i> of Olympus came nearer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
seat of her care, nearer the dread home of her daughter:
passed from Homer to Theocritus; from the
adoration of the higher priesthood of Greece, to
become merged in the Ceres of Rome, the goddess
beloved of the lowly, who received the first fruits
of the field amidst joyful measures of dance and
song. But it is the <i>haute dame</i> that strikes our
imagination&mdash;the staid and mystic Demeter of
Eleusis, and not the Ceres of the Roman lyric. The
light-hearted Ceres, as a beautiful woman in the
prime of life, may be adorned with poppies and wheat-ears,
may stand serene and smiling as a symbol of
harvest or the goddess of a Latin temple; but paint
her as one will, she will do little more than serve
to show how fallen are the idols&mdash;how immeasurable
is the descent from the stately Earth-Mother whose
image would be stamped on the brain of a Phidias.</p>

<p>But where is the Phidian Demeter? Surely such
a goddess, "deeply musing in her hallowed shrine,"
was a theme for the carver of the immortal Zeus
and Athena! Perhaps those inscrutable headless
"Fates" from the Parthenon, so wonderful in noble
grace that the conception of befitting heads
is beyond the reach of our minds, include the
Earth-Mother and her daughter! How easy it is to
imagine the reclining figure as Persephone leaning
upon the mother who loved her so well! But we
must be content with what we have of Demeter in
art, which is little more than a few fifth century
frieze reliefs, the figure from Cnidos attributed to
Scopas,<a name="FNanchor_A_54" id="FNanchor_A_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_54" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> and some Damophon memories of Phidias.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>So the artist is free and untrammelled in respect
of the representation of the far-famed goddess.
There is no definite type of her which has fixed itself
on the minds of men, though the legend and story
weaved about her name are beautiful and wonderful
in a high degree.</p>


<h4><br />ATHENA</h4>

<p>Though swathed in legend and surrounded with
a hallow of Grecian reverence, Athena is always
cold. She may dim the sun with the radiance of
her armour; ride in a flaming car, and have Strength
and Invisibility for her allies; but she fights only
on the side of the strong, and uses the tactics of
spies against her enemies. With the Gorgon's head
on her shield, and a helmet which will cover the
soldiers of a hundred towns, she yet whispers advice
to Grecian heroes, and deflects a Trojan arrow in
its flight. Truly as Goddess of War she is somewhat
difficult to generalize. But she is also the divinity
of the arts and sciences; invents the pipe and the
shuttle, and becomes the depository of all industrial
knowledge. Hence she embodies the triumphs of
peace and war&mdash;combines the extremes of human
exertion.</p>

<p>How Phidias overcame the task of representing
the goddess is well known. He generalized war and
wisdom, and from his great work of the Parthenon
there can be little departure in respect of bearing
and attitude, so long as the province of war is symbolized
in the design. The actual work of the
Greek master has disappeared, but from various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
records and copies, it would appear that the Parthenon
Athena was the loftiest conception ever
worked out in sculpture, if we except the Olympian
Zeus. Majestic grace and the unconscious power
derived from supreme knowledge, seem to have
been the first qualities exhibited in the statue. In
the fourth century there was no great departure
from the Phidian ideal, and it is difficult to see how
there could be much modification in the direction
of bringing the conception closer to earth, for the
goddess had no special presumed form which could
be adapted by the artist to popular ideas. A nude
figure would be impossible because in this the force
and power implied in a hero of war could not be
combined with feminine attributes. The Greeks
drew the line at observable muscular developments,
invariably clothing nearly the whole of the figure,
but they did not, and could not, free her general
bearing from certain masculine qualities. It is
true that the costume of the goddess might be modified,
and Phidias himself represented her in one or
two statues without a helmet, an example followed
by several artists of the Renaissance,<a name="FNanchor_A_55" id="FNanchor_A_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_55" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> but so long
as the symbols of war are included in her habit,
she can be only of formal use to the painter.</p>


<h4><br />APOLLO</h4>

<p>Although in mythology Apollo is connected with
everything on earth which is useful or pleasing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>mankind, in art custom has so confined his representation
in respect of both appearance and symbols,
that a type has been established from which it would
be difficult to depart without a suggestion of incongruity
arising. This type is of a more purely formal
character than that of any other god, except perhaps
Mercury, a circumstance probably arising from the
fact that the reputed hard nature of Apollo fails to
lend itself to sympathetic idealization. He does
not appear to have been a favourite subject with the
greatest sculptors of ancient times, for nearly all
the innumerable statues of him which have come
down to us, are reproductions of two or three types
which in themselves vary but little. It is difficult
to see how a really noble ideal of such a god can be
suggested. Stern and inflexible, with many human
vices but no weaknesses or gentle traits, and withal
a model of physical beauty without strength or
apparent power&mdash;in fact an emphasized feminine
form: such is the Apollo of tradition and art. We
cannot wonder that the type was quickly fixed, the
limitations to avoid the abnormal being so well
defined.</p>

<p>The painter then has small scope with the figure
of this god. He may only slightly vary the accepted
form, which admits of but a negative expression.
The best representation of Apollo in modern art
is the one by Raphael in the Parnassus fresco at the
Vatican, though the beautiful figure in the Marsyas
work at the Louvre is very nearly as perfect.<a name="Eanchor_48" id="Eanchor_48"></a><a href="#Enote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
Raphael does not give to the god the rounded swellings
of a female form, but overcomes the difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
by showing him as a young man of perfect figure
who has just reached maturity. The expression is
entirely general, but does not suggest a god-like
power.</p>


<h4><br />DIANA</h4>

<p>It would scarcely be natural to be sympathetic
with Artemis. She seems to be the feminine type
of a cold flint-like nature, as Apollo is the masculine,
and one can well understand that mythology makes
of them brother and sister. Mistress of wild beasts
and goddess of sudden death, she was always worshipped
from fear: her wrath had ever to be appeased;
she inspired neither affection nor respect. True,
she wore the mantle of Ililythia, but only to be
dreaded, and even the attempt to throw a warm
halo over her by the theft of the Endymion story
for her benefit, failed to lift her reputation for the
tireless satisfaction of a supernatural spleen. Nevertheless
for the painter Diana has always had a
certain attraction, because the legends connected
with her offer opportunities for the exercise of skill
in the representation of the nude. But there is
an end of all things, and the bathing and hunting
scenes have been fairly exhausted. For the sculptor
only is Artemis likely to live. Bright colours are
not the vehicle to represent the symbol of an idea
which is beyond, but not above, nature&mdash;a useless
abstraction which neither warms the heart nor
elevates the soul. Callisto draws our sympathy,
and Niobe our tears: the goddess freezes our
veins.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h4><br />NEPTUNE</h4>

<p>Brother of Jupiter and Pluto; sire of Theseus,
of Polyphemus, and of the titanic lads who threatened
to pile mountain on mountain in order to destroy
the home of the deities; the god whose footsteps
tremble the earth; who disputes with the sun; who
uses floods and earthquakes for weapons; who owns
vast palaces in the caverns of the deep; for whom the
angry waves sink down beneath the shining sea,
and ocean monsters play around his lightning track
across the waters: this is the divinity whom the
painter is accustomed to portray as a rough bearded
man with dishevelled hair and rugged features, holding
a three-pronged fork, and associating with dolphins,
mermaids, and shells. But Neptune is not
a popular god. He does not appeal to the mind as
a good-natured god like Jupiter or Mercury, with
many of the virtues and some of the failings of mankind.
His acts are mostly violent; he punishes but
does not reward; grows angry but is never kind.
There is consequently no sympathetic attitude
towards him on the part of the artist, who would
sooner paint good than bad actions. Beyond his
violent acts, the circumstances which make up the
history of the god, provide subjects more suitable
for the poet than the painter, who is practically
confined to unimportant and casual incidents which,
with changes of accessories, would answer a thousand
scenes in mythological history. Neptune then may
well disappear from the purview of the painter, with
the tritons and the seaweed entourage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h4><br />MARS</h4>

<p>From the point of view of the painter, there is
little to say about the Grecian Ares. He has not a
single good trait in legend or story, and we know
nothing of his presumed personal form beyond the
military externals. It is difficult to understand how
such a god came to be included among the deities
of a civilized race. Of what service could be prayer
when it is addressed to a blatant, bloodstained,
genius of the brutal side of war, without feeling or
pity, and apparently so wanting in intelligence that
he has to leave the direction of battles to a goddess?
One would think that Homer intended him as the
god of bullies, or he would not have made him roar
like ten thousand men when struck with a stone,
nor would he have allowed him to be imprisoned
by two young demigods, and contemptuously
wounded by a third. But who is responsible for
the association of such a wretched example of divinity
with the radiant Aphrodite, for surely it is
only the cloak of Homer that covers the story!
Was it a painter who had sought in vain from the
poets a suggestion for a composition in which the
god would at least appear normal, or a cynical critic
who wished to incite ridicule as well as contempt for
the divinity? In any case the painter must sigh
in vain for an inspiriting design with Ares as the
leading figure: he cannot harmonize love and terror.</p>

<p>The Roman Mars has a slight advantage over
Ares, for the name of Silvia is sweetly-sounding,
but she should be represented alone, as the star of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>the wild Campagna, while yet it was forest-clad:
the gleaming light whose rays are to illumine the
earth. Mars may disappear with the wolf, but who
can hide the glory of Rome?</p>


<h4><br />MERCURY</h4>

<p>It is difficult to connect the Hermes of the poet
with the tedious expressionless figure commonly
seen in painting, whose only costume is a helmet,
and whose invariable province is apparently to look
on and do nothing. For the sculptor he is a god;
for the painter a symbol of subordination. A Rubens
may give him the pulse of life, but only the
sculptor can suggest the divinity. With the painter
the winged helmet is a bizarre ornament; the immortal
sandals are shrunken to leather; the caduceus
is a thing of inertia which is ever in the way. But
with the sculptor all these things may be endowed
with the quickening spirit of a soaring mind, for
does not Giovanni di Bologna show the lithesome
god speeding through space ahead of the wind, the
feathery foot-wings humming with delirium, the
trembling air dividing hastily before the wand?
True, the painter may represent the divine herald
on his way through space, as when he conducts
Psyche to Olympus, or leads the shades of the suitors
to Hades; but the accessories present must
surround him with an earthy framework, unless the
design be confined to a ceiling, and shut away from
things mundane with architectural forms, as in the
plan of Raphael at the Farnese Villa, or to a fresco
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>executed in the manner of a Flaxman drawing.
Beyond these artifices the artist cannot go with
propriety.</p>

<p>Few and worn are the scenes in the history of the
god in which he takes a leading part. The head of
Argus seems to be cut off, or awaiting separation,
in nearly every collection, sometimes with Juno on
a cloud deeply frowning with revengeful ire, occasionally
with the peacock expectant of its glorious
fan, but always with the weak-looking helmeted
piper, passive and unconcerned as if fulfilling a daily
task. A Correggio may weave his golden fancy
around a scene where Cupid learns to strengthen
his arrows with the rules of science and the wiles of
art; but let the painter beware of the infant Bacchus
in the arms of the messenger-god, lest a vision
of the Olympian group arise and enfold his work in
a robe of charity. The schemes whereby the cradled
thief deceived the Pythian god are beyond the scope
of the painter, though there is a certain available
range in the charming actions surrounding the invention
of the lyre. And if the designs relating to
the unfortunate Lara be properly consigned to oblivion,
surely the connection of Hermes with Pandora
offers a field for the sprightly imagination. But save
where the god is a symbol of commerce or speed, the
helmet should be dispensed with, for it is hackneyed
beyond endurance. The modern painter is not bound
by custom unless the provision of beauty conflict with
the lucidity of the design or the reverence for universal
sentiment. Let the winged heels suffice, for
the shadow of Persius will scarcely rise in protest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h4><br />BACCHUS</h4>

<p>Centuries of bacchanalian festivities and revelries
have nearly killed Bacchus for the painter. Who
can further interest himself in meaningless processions,
where the most prominent figure is a fat,
drunken, staggering man, supported by goat-hoofed
monstrosities, and attended by all the insignia of
vinous royalty? Silenus is no more the loving nurse
of the infant god; the satyrs are no more the followers
of a reed-playing woodland deity; the nymphs
have long forgotten the flowery dales, the faithful
trees that lived and died with them, the fairy bowers
where first Semele's offspring clapped his hands to
the measure of dance and pipe. Why should the
dance be turned into a drunken revel? Why should
the artist remember the orgies of Rome, and forget
the Grecian pastoral fancies? What has become of
Dionysus, inheritor of Vishnu traditions, the many-named
father of song, the leader of the Muses, and
the fire-born enemy of pirates? Nothing remains of
him worth remembering, save Ariadne the golden-haired,
and she must in future be left on the desert
isle lest the pathos of her figure be disturbed by the
motley followers of her rescuer.</p>

<p>It is passing strange that the artists of the Renaissance
did not attempt to lift Bacchus out of the
ditch of ignominy into which he had fallen. They
seem to have taken their ideas from the recorded
accounts of the Roman rites and vine festivals,
overlooking the Grecian suggestions relating to
Dionysus, and even the later restrained reliefs pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>turing
incidents in his history. In their art, however,
as is evidenced by Pompeian frescoes, the Romans
often treated Bacchus in a serious manner, associating
him with higher interests than those connected
with festival orgies. It may be that the figure of
the god carved by Michelangelo<a name="FNanchor_A_56" id="FNanchor_A_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_56" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> had something to
do with the later coarse representations of him, for
it would have been impossible for artists succeeding
so great a sculptor, to ignore the types he created.
But it will be an eternal mystery how he came to
design such a Bacchus. A voluptuous semi-realistic
god, opposed to everything else that was conceived
by the sculptor, and antagonistic to all that was
known in Greece, it can never be anything more
than a sublime example of a purely earthly figure.
One stands amazed before the perfect modelling,
but aghast at the conception. It represents the
most extraordinary transition from the god-like man
of the Greeks, to a man-like god, ever seen in art.</p>

<p>The painter then has little left to use of the conventional
Bacchus and his history, except the never-dying
Ariadne, but there is nothing to prevent him
from reverting to the pastoral Dionysus, to the
delightful abodes of the nymphs his foster-mothers,
where Pan played and the Muses sang, while the
never-tiring son of Maia breathed tales of love into
willing ears.</p>


<h4><br />VULCAN</h4>

<p>The poet may continue to hold our fancy with
volcanic fires and cyclopean hammers, but on canvas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Etna becomes a blacksmith's forge, and the figure
of a begrimed human toiler is given to the divinity
responsible for the golden handmaids, and the brazen
bull whose breath was scorching flame. There is
rarely a painting of Vulcan without a forge and
leather bellows, with a smith who is stripped to the
waist, which earthly things necessarily kill all suggestions
of celestial interest, notwithstanding the
presence of Venus, or the never-fading bride of
palsied Peleus. Occasionally we have the incident
with Mars, and strangely look for the invisible net,
but not finding it we are immediately called back to
earth to ponder over the wiles of the ancient legend
gatherers. The art is lost behind the unreality.
But why does not the painter revert to the childhood
of Vulcan, when he was hiding in the glistening
cavern beneath the roll of ocean, fashioning
resplendent eardrops for silver-footed Thetis? Here
is scope for the imagination&mdash;to indicate the fancies
of the budding genius who was to carve the wondrous
shield, and adorn the heaven-domed halls of Olympus.
Let Heph&aelig;stus mature as he will for the poet:
he should only bloom for the painter.</p>


<h4><br />GENERAL CLASSICAL COMPOSITIONS</h4>

<p>Scenes of adventure from the ancient poets in
which the gods and goddesses are concerned, appear
to be rapidly becoming things of the past for the
painter. This is partly due to the circumstance
that these scenes have been so multiplied since the
early days of the Renaissance, that they are now posi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>tively
fatiguing to both artists and the public; but
there is a deeper reason. If we try to number the
paintings of classical subjects by first-class artists
which are enshrined in our minds, we can count
very few, and nearly all of these are single figures,
as a Venus, a Leda, a Psyche, or a Pandora. We
do not call up a Judgment of Paris, or a Diana
and Act&aelig;on, or any other design where divinities
are mixed with mortals in earthly actions. The
cause of this seems to be that our minds naturally
revolt against a glaring incongruity. The imagination
is unable to harmonize the qualities of a god
with the possession of human instincts and frailties,
or strike a balance between divine actions and human
motives. We see these pictures and admire the
design and execution, but they leave us cold: we
are unable to kindle enthusiasm over patent unreality.
The general conclusion is that painters would
be wise to avoid such compositions, and confine their
attention in classical work to single figures of goddesses
or heroines, leaving to the poet suggestion of
miraculous powers.</p>

<h3>EXPRESSION. PART IV.&mdash;GENERAL IDEALS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Limitation of the painter with general ideals&mdash;Ideal heads interchangeable
in sacred and symbolical art&mdash;Ideal male human
countenances impossible for the painter.</p>


<p>In the arts of sculpture and painting, where it is
necessary that the beauty should be immediately
recognized by the eye, it is obvious that a general
expression is superior to the particular. This is so
because the general covers universal experience and
the particular does not. But in the art of the painter
there is a limit to the expression of general beauty.
Theoretically there is no beauty possible to the
sculptor which the painter cannot produce, but
practically there is. A sculptor may carve what we
understand as a god-like figure&mdash;a glorious image
embodying all the highest qualities that may be
conceived by man, with a general expression covering
supreme wisdom and every noble attribute&mdash;such a
figure as the greatest Grecian artist chiselled. This
figure would stand in front of us, isolated, serene in
its glory, and we should look and wonder, and a
second or two would suffice to fill our entire mind
with the image. For it would be above the earth,
above all our surroundings. We could connect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
nothing on earth with it&mdash;neither human beings,
nor green fields, nor the seas, and certainly not
human habitations, and ways, and manners, and
actions. A Phidian god can have no setting. Everything
on earth is too small, too insignificant to bear
it company. The reflection from the majesty of
the design throws into shadow our loftiest earthly
conceptions.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a painter could be found who
could execute such a figure: how could he isolate
it to the mind? He may not use accessories, for
these could not be separated by the eye, and the
association with earth which they would imply
would destroy the illusion. But the figure must
have relief, and hence tones. A monochrome would
not do, for the frame or sides of the wall containing
the picture would flatten it, and suggest a painted
imitation of a sculpture. We may imagine a colossal
figure painted on an immense wall whose bounds
are hidden by the concentration of all the available
light on the figure. Even then the colouring of the
wall must be unseen. The figure must stand out as
if against infinite space, surrounded by ambient
air, in majestic solitude, pondering over the everlasting
roll of life towards perfection. In this way
only could the painter match the sculptor, but
the practical difficulties are so enormous as to
render the scheme to all intents and purposes
impossible.</p>

<p>For the painter then there is a limit to expression.
He cannot proceed with his ideal higher than Praxiteles.
His limit is the most supreme form and ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>pression
conceivable by his imagination, which does
not exceed the apparent possibility of human experience.
Apparent, because an ideal must necessarily
be actually above the possibility of experience, but
it may not appear to be so. For instance a Raphael
Madonna does not seem to represent a supernatural
woman. There is no single feature painted which
cannot be matched in life, and hence it would not
occur to the observer that the expression is contrary
to the possibility of experience. But the expression
cannot be met with in life, for besides being entirely
general, it excludes all phases due to the emotions
or passions. One cannot imagine a woman with the
expression of a Raphael Madonna having concern
with any special human interest, and least of all
with feelings and failings arising from natural instincts.
Yet the expression covers every form of
noble endeavour; every phase of innocent pleasure;
every degree of mental activity within the province
of woman. And herein lies the art&mdash;the exclusion
of the bad in our nature, with the exaltation of the
good.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that if the expression be so general
that no particular quality can be identified therein,
the countenance will serve for the head of any
personage painted in whose expression it is desirable
to indicate the possession of high attributes, without
suggesting a particular condition of mind. Thus,
the head of a Raphael Madonna would equally
serve for the head of a Saint Cecilia or a Judith;
or, providing the age were suitable, for a heroine of
the stamp of Joan of Arc, so long as the character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of her actual features were unknown. Further it
would be well adapted for a symbolical figure, as
Prudence or Truth.</p>

<p>But a far wider significance than is thus indicated,
is conveyed by the necessity for generalizing expression
in order to reach the painter's ideal. It has
already been noted that inasmuch as all men have
the same general idea of beauty&mdash;that they generally
agree as to what is, or is not, beautiful, it follows
that there must be a common opinion as to degrees
of beauty, and so a universality of ideal; that is of
course, among people with similar experience of
life, as for instance the white races of the world.<a name="Eanchor_49" id="Eanchor_49"></a><a href="#Enote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
Hence the ideals of all painters must be similar. They
must necessarily aim for the same generalization&mdash;exclude
or emphasize like. Manner or style, or
national type may vary; purely sensorial effects
may differ as the minds of the painters have been
variously trained, but the combination of features
and effects which regulate the expression will be
practically identical in every realized ideal. Consequently,
subject to changes in attitude or age,
ideal heads of all artists are interchangeable without
incongruity resulting, irrespective of the motive of
the design, for the ideal countenance indicated adapts
itself to any character where no emotional or passionate
expression is required. The head of the
figure representing "Profane Love" in Titian's great
picture, would serve to express spiritual nobility
in a Madonna,<a name="FNanchor_A_57" id="FNanchor_A_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_57" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> and when a head in a Madonna
by Raphael is exchanged with that of the central
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>figure in Fragonard's The Pursuit,<a name="FNanchor_B_58" id="FNanchor_B_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_58" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> there is no resulting
suggestion of impropriety in either picture.<a name="FNanchor_C_59" id="FNanchor_C_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_59" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Ideal countenances have sometimes been given to
evil characters, as in Luini's Salome,<a name="FNanchor_D_60" id="FNanchor_D_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_60" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> and the
head in this picture would equally well serve for a
Madonna.<a name="FNanchor_E_61" id="FNanchor_E_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_61" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>An ideal head then will suggest any expression
that the design in which it is included seems to
require, subject to the restrictions before noted. In
The Pursuit the face of the woman presumed to
be fleeing from her lover indicates some concern,
and even a little fear,<a name="FNanchor_E_62" id="FNanchor_E_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_62" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> but that this is due to the
surroundings in the work, is shown when the head
is substituted for another in a different picture, for
the concern has disappeared, and the expression
becomes one which may properly represent the
highest attributes connected with the Madonna.</p>

<p>The limits within which the form and countenance
of a woman may be idealized, are prescribed
by Raphael in his works. The presumed age must
be that when she reaches the full bloom of womanhood.
Youth will not do because it involves an
expression denying experience, while physically a
girl cannot be supposed to have reached an age
where her form has ceased to progress towards perfection.
Beauty of feature and form is the first
consideration of the artist, and hence his difficulty
in fixing an expression which shall be entirely free
from the possibility of suggesting desire. For this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>reason no model, or series of models, will suffice the
painter: he has always to bring his imagination to
bear, as Raphael admitted he had to do.<a name="FNanchor_A_63" id="FNanchor_A_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_63" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to find a head of a woman, painted
before the time of Raphael, which fulfils the requirements
of art as an ideal. The figures are either too
formal, or too distinctive in type, or are evidently
portraits, while in many of the greatest pictures of
the fifteenth century the artists had not yet learned
how to put warm blood into their Madonnas. Raphael,
however, after taking up his sojourn at Florence,
became an object lesson for nearly every school,
and ideal countenances were produced by other
masters, though no painter other than Raphael
succeeded with more than one or two. Nowadays
the ever increasing hustle in the struggle for existence,
does not lend itself to deep study and long
contemplation on the part of painters, but hope
springs eternal, and surely the list of immortals
is not yet closed.</p>

<p>An ideal man of flesh and blood is not possible
in the art of the painter, for there is no general conception
of male beauty below the level of the god-like.
Perfection of form can be given, but a supreme
expression in the face of a man implies deep wisdom,
and this must necessarily be associated with maturity
when high sensorial beauty of feature can scarcely
be expected.</p>

the commonplace of scenic arrangement, the imagination
of the portrait painter cannot be carried further
than the consideration of added or eliminated details
of form and expression in relation to a set subject.
But these details are very difficult, and so it comes
about that a good portrait involves a far greater
proportion of mental labour than the result appears on
the surface to warrant. It is indirectly consequent
upon the complexity of his task that the work of the
artist who devotes practically his whole time to portraiture,
often varies so largely in quality. He paints
some portraits which are generally appreciated, but
as time goes on he is overwhelmed with orders which
he cannot possibly fulfil without reducing the value
of his work. He thus acquires a habit of throwing his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
whole power into his work only when the personage
he represents is of public importance, or has a countenance
particularly amenable to his manner or style.
It is necessary that this fact should be borne in mind,
otherwise erroneous standards are likely to be set up
when artists like Van Dyck, Reynolds, or Romney,
are referred to as examples.</p>

<p>In a general sense nearly all painting where the
human figure is introduced, is portraiture, and it has
been so since soon after the middle of the fifteenth
century, when artists commenced to use living men
and women for secondary or accessory figures in
sacred pictures. The increasing importance attached
to the anatomy of the figure resulted in the extensive
use of models, and so in a measure portraiture rose
to be a leading feature in the work of the artist. The
figures in the larger compositions of every kind by
the greater painters of the late fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries, consist almost entirely of portraits
of friends and acquaintances of the artists, the
exceptions being the countenances of the Deity and
Christ, which had to be modelled from accepted
types, and those of the later Saints the character of
whose features had been handed down by tradition.
A few painters, as Raphael and Correggio, idealized
the Virgin away from suggestion of portraiture, but
others, as Del Sarto and Pontormo, even in this case
took a wife or other relative as a model. The practice
was continued by many artists in respect of central
figures, till the end of the seventeenth century,
after which time the identity of the figures was, as a
rule, purposely lost. Nevertheless the figures, other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
than ideals, used in all good compositions, must
necessarily be portraits or adaptations thereof, for
only from life can superior representation of life be
obtained.</p>

<p>The first duty of the portraitist is to generalize the
expression of his subject. A face seen once will be
thrown upon the mind only with the particular expression
observable at the moment of view. If seen
a second time we involuntarily combine the effects
of the dual experience, and the more often we see the
countenance, the more closely will our mental picture
of it correspond with the general or average expression
worn. It is this average appearance that the
portraitist tries to represent, emphasizing of course
whatever good qualities may be indicated. The
second most important task of the artist is to balance
every part of the picture, so that neither setting, nor
colour, nor handling, is strikingly noticeable. The
portrait should appear at first glance as one complete
whole, in order that the mind of the observer be
immediately directed to the subject, and away from
the artist or the manner of execution. The painter is
limited to the actual character and physiognomy of
the figure. He must make each feature harmonize
with the others, and add or subtract, hide or reveal,
without changing the general individuality, but he
cannot do more. His scope is, therefore, strictly
limited. Very naturally some of the greatest portraitists
have rebelled at this limit. They appear to
have painted with an eye to posterity, rather than to
satisfy their patrons and the people of the time with
an effective generalization of character and bearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
If we compare the portraits executed by Titian with
those representing certain accessory figures in some
important compositions of the great masters, as for
instance, the School of Athens of Raphael,<a name="FNanchor_A_64" id="FNanchor_A_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_64" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> and the
Death of St. Francis of Ghirlandaio,<a name="FNanchor_B_65" id="FNanchor_B_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_65" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> we find a
marked difference. The latter are obviously true
portraits of living men, with little accentuated or
eliminated, just such portraits as Carlyle wanted
from which to obtain real instruction for his biographies.
Titian painted no portraits of this kind. He
gives a lofty bearing to every person he portrays. His
figures seem to belong to a special race of men, endowed
with rare qualities of nobility and dignity,
with little interest in the doings of ordinary people.
Yet we know that some of his characters lived in an
atmosphere of evil. We cannot really believe that
the Aretino of Titian<a name="FNanchor_C_66" id="FNanchor_C_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_66" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> was Aretino the man, and
we find it hard to imagine that Philip II.,<a name="FNanchor_D_67" id="FNanchor_D_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_67" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> or the
Duke of Alba,<a name="FNanchor_E_68" id="FNanchor_E_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_68" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> as Titian painted him, could grow
into the monster he proved to be. Nevertheless
Titian was justified. It is not the business of the
artist to consider the historian: his art is all that
concerns him. Titian produced beautiful pictures
which are commonly recognized as great portrayals
of character; whose character matters not, though
when we have data upon which to rest a judgment,
we find the lineaments in his works are fully sufficient
for purposes of identification.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>While Titian went further than any other Renaissance
painter in ennobling his subjects, he did not
approach the ancient Greeks in this respect. Their
sculptured busts and terms represent the highest
portraiture known to us. Many examples remain,
mostly copies it is true, but quite fifty of them are
clearly faithful reproductions, made apparently in
the early days of Imperial Rome, and accord closely
with the few existing originals. The Grecian portraits
differ from the Roman, and all later painted or
carved portraits in a most important feature.<a name="FNanchor_A_69" id="FNanchor_A_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_69" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
The latter aimed at what is still understood as the highest
level in portraiture. They endeavoured to give a
general individualism of mind and bearing, avoiding
particular expression; in fact to represent character.
Since the Christian era commenced neither sculptor
nor painter has gone further than this, with very few
exceptions in Roman days when Grecian sculptors
of the time imitated the practice of the fourth and
early third centuries. The earlier Greeks on the
other hand not only generalized portraits in an
extreme degree, but, except in the case of athletes,
they altered the contour of the head and varied the
actual features of the subject, so that the possession
of the higher human attributes should be indicated
as clearly as possible. They invariably showed a
large facial angle, placed the ears well close to the
head, sunk the eyes deep in their sockets, and ennobled
the brows to suggest majesty or profound
thought. In fact the Grecian portrait heads only
differ from their sculptured gods in that particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
countenances are depicted, and consequently the
expression in them does not appear to be above the
possibility of human experience. Apparently in
Grecian times, only men who had become celebrated
in some way were represented in stone, and hence
the artist had features to depict which could be
semi-idealized without impropriety. Even Socrates,
whose ugliness was proverbial, was given a noble and
dignified expression.<a name="FNanchor_B_70" id="FNanchor_B_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_70" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>That the painter is at liberty to follow the example
of the Greeks, there can be no question from the
point of view of art, for his first object is to produce
a beautiful picture; but in portraiture, practical and
conventional considerations have to be met, with
which other branches of painting are not concerned.
With rare exceptions the portraits executed are of
living persons, and extreme accentuation of high
qualities would be likely to result in a representation
of the sitter that would appear false to contemporary
observers, though we might well imagine that a work
exhibiting this accentuation would seem to be of
high excellence in the judgment of future generations.
There must therefore be a line drawn in respect of
added or accentuated qualities, and the position
of this line would naturally vary with the celebrity of
the subject and the power of the artist. Something
definite may, however, be said in regard to the emphasis
of certain qualities of form, and particularly
of dignity, a feature that has occupied the attention
of some of the greatest masters.</p>


<p>The question arises, how far may the artist go in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>imitating the manner of the stage with his portraits?
On the theatrical stage formalities are required with
certain characters in order to emphasize their position&mdash;to
assist in the recognition of their standing or
relative significance in the drama, for it is of the first
importance that the audience should comprehend the
meaning of the actions presented as rapidly as
possible. The actor must often exaggerate life
habits of pose and manner in order to heighten the
contrast between two characters, or to give special
significance to the words. And the elevation of the
diction sometimes compels this exaggeration. In
high drama where the language used is above
experience of ordinary life in measure and force,
there must be appropriate pose and action to accompany
it, and hence a height of dignity or even
majesty may appear perfectly proper on the stage,
which would be ridiculous in surroundings away
from it. From the practice of certain painters it
would seem that they have looked upon portraiture
as the transference of their subjects to the public
stage as it were, so that they might appear to occupy
a higher position in the drama of life than that to
which they are habituated. No harm can arise from
this provided the portraitist does not pass beyond
the custom of the theatrical stage, where, whatever
the exaggeration, the representation appears, or
should appear, appropriate to the action; that is to
say, where the exaggeration is not recognized as such.
Accentuation of high qualities of expression, or even
variations in certain physical features, such as the
Greeks brought about, would not appear exaggera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tions
in a portrait, but where dignity of form is added
to such an extent that the observer immediately
recognizes it as untrue to experience, then the artist
goes too far. While this is so, we do not condemn
Titian, Van Dyck, and the few other portrait painters
who emphasized the quality of dignity of form
in past times. The reason for this appears to be that
the usual methods of teaching history lead us to
suppose that nobles and leaders of society in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, who were
usually the portrait subjects of the greater artists,
commonly assumed a demeanour and bearing far
above our own experience. At the present day, when
it is a matter of universal knowledge that a formal
dignified pose is very rarely assumed by any one,
such a bearing in a portrait would be regarded as
untrue.</p>

<p>The portraitist may improve the expression of his
subject, adding any good quality within his power,
and he may remove from the features or figure any
marked physical defect, because the portrait would
still appear to be correct; but if he add a strong
dignified pose, then the result would be something
that is possibly, but improbably accurate, and therefore
inferior art. The quality of dignity should be
expressed rather in the countenance than in the pose,
the bearing of the form being produced as in life,
for this lends assistance to the true representation of
character. A dignified expression may well be appropriate
to an awkward form whose personality would
be undistinguished by dignity of pose.</p>

<p>Titian was the first great artist to give a pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>nounced
dignity of form to his subjects, and he never
varied from the practice unless the subject were
exhibited in action,<a name="FNanchor_A_71" id="FNanchor_A_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_71" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> or too old to be represented as
an upright figure.<a name="FNanchor_B_72" id="FNanchor_B_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_72" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> Nor did he once exaggerate the
pose so that arrogance might be suggested. Though
he squared the shoulders, he rarely threw back the
head to emphasize the bearing,<a name="FNanchor_C_73" id="FNanchor_C_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_73" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> and only in one
portrait is the body slightly arched as the result of
the pose.<a name="FNanchor_D_74" id="FNanchor_D_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_74" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> In fact so careful was the artist in
avoiding over-emphasis, that there is a tendency in
two or three of his figures for the upper part of the
body to lean a little forward.<a name="FNanchor_E_75" id="FNanchor_E_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_75" class="fnanchor">[l]</a> Obviously Titian
gave this dignified attitude to his portrait subjects
of set purpose, as in his general compositions there
is no suggestion of it.<a name="Eanchor_51" id="Eanchor_51"></a><a href="#Enote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Velasquez no doubt acquired his habit of lending
dignity to his important subjects from the examples
of Titian's portraits which came under his view in
Spain. Except in one notable instance where the
bearing is much over-emphasized,<a name="FNanchor_F_76" id="FNanchor_F_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_76" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> he was equally
successful with the Italian master in the practice,
though many of his characters are far from lending
him any natural assistance. In the case of a Court
Dwarf, however, the high dignity given to him by
the painter seems to require explanation.<a name="FNanchor_G_77" id="FNanchor_G_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_77" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Before he went to Italy, Van Dyck followed the
natural system of Rubens in posing his portrait subjects,
but at Genoa he painted under the spell of
Titian's memory, and thereafter during his whole life,
he gave a dignified bearing to his figures whenever
this was not opposed to individual traits. During
his English period, when he undertook more work
than he could properly accomplish, he sometimes
over-emphasized the dignity of a figure by arching
the body,<a name="FNanchor_A_78" id="FNanchor_A_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_78" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> but as a rule he produced a just balance
of pose and setting, completing altogether a magnificent
series of portraits which remain the astonishment
of the world.</p>

<p>It is obviously the duty of the portraitist so to design
his work that the attention of the observer is
concentrated upon the countenance of the subject
immediately he has grasped the whole composition,
and it is in the successful accomplishment of this
object that the power of Rembrandt lies. He rarely
used accessories, and in only a few cases a background
of any kind. He avoided portraits where an elaborate
setting was required, as for instance full length
standing figures, of which he only painted two<a name="FNanchor_B_79" id="FNanchor_B_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_79" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>;
and in his many three-quarter length portraits, there
is seldom more than a table or chair to be seen apart
from the figure. With this simplicity of design, and
with nearly all the available light directed full upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>the head of the subject, the eye of the observer of
the picture is necessarily centred instantaneously
upon the features. These are invariably cast into
bold relief by perfect management of the chiaroscuro,
and the correspondence with life seems as complete
as it well can be. Rembrandt thus accomplishes the
aim of every great artist: he executes a faithful
picture, and throws it on the mind of the observer
with the maximum of rapidity. Only artists of a
high order can successfully ignore a more or less
elaborate setting for a portrait, particularly if it be
larger than bust size. Great care has to be taken
with such a setting lest the eye of the observer be
attracted by the pose of the figure and the general
harmony of the work before being directed to the
countenance. If we take the general opinion of
known portraits, so far as it can be gauged, we find
that the most highly esteemed of them are: the Julius
II. of Raphael, the Mona Lisa of Lionardo, the Man
with the Gloves by Titian, the Old Man with a Boy
by Ghirlandaio, and Innocent X. by Velasquez.<a name="FNanchor_C_80" id="FNanchor_C_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_80" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
All of these except Mona Lisa are remarkable for
the simplicity of the setting, and in the exception
the formal landscape is altogether subordinated to the
figure. Raphael was the first artist who saw the
value of avoiding accessories in portraiture. His
half-length portraits painted after his arrival in
Florence, are all free from them, and his Julius II.
has only the chair on which the Pope is seated.</p>

<p>Rembrandt further aided the concentration of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>attention on the countenance of a sitter by the use
of warm inconspicuous tones in the clothing, which
harmonize with all kinds of surroundings in which the
picture may be seen. The colours never specially
attract the eye, and the attire consequently forms so
completely a part of the figure, that after an inspection
of the work one can rarely describe the costume.
This subordination of colour is of the highest importance
in portraiture, though it is not sufficiently
practised nowadays. Velasquez used quiet tones
whenever possible, that is, when he was not painting
great personages, and Titian, Rubens, and Van Dyck,
followed the same course in half-length portraits.
None of these, however, seemed so careful as Rembrandt
in adapting the tones to the general character
of the figure, so that the impression left on the mind
of the observer should relate entirely to the personality.
Rembrandt, in fact, aimed at a representation
of the man, and the man only; and he gave us a
natural human being of a commonly known type,
with his virtues somewhat emphasized, and his faults
a little veiled.</p>

<p>The extraordinary power of Velasquez as a portraitist
was due to the same general cause operating
in the case of Rembrandt, namely, extreme simplicity
in design. Apart from those instances where royal or
official personages had to be represented in decorative
attire, every portrait of Velasquez is merely the
impress of a personality. There are no accessories;
the clothing is subordinated to the last degree, and
there is nothing for the eye to grasp but a perfectly
drawn set of features thrown into strong relief by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a method of chiaroscuro unsurpassed in depth and
accuracy. Thus, as in the case of Rembrandt, the
portrait fulfils the first law of art&mdash;the picture is
thrown on the brain in the least possible fraction of
time.</p>

<p>Velasquez was remarkable in a greater degree than
any other artist, if we except Hals, for his facility in
execution. In his brush-work he appeared to do the
right thing at all times without hesitation, achieving
the most perfect balance as if by instinct. So far as
we can judge from those instances where his subjects
were painted also by other artists, his portraits are
good likenesses, but he followed the best practice in
generalizing the countenance to the fullest extent.
It is unfortunate that his work was confined to so
poor a variety of sitters. Of his known portraits
more than half represent Philip IV. or his relatives;
eight others are nobles of the time, and another half
dozen are dwarfs and buffoons, leaving only seventeen
examples of the artist's work amongst ordinary
people. There never was a weaker royal family than
that of Philip IV., and it is really astonishing how
Velasquez was able to produce such excellent works
of art by means of their portraits. With his abnormal
lips and weak face, the king himself must have
been a most difficult person to ennoble, yet the
painter managed in three portraits to give him a
highly distinguished countenance and bearing, without
in any way suggesting exaggeration.<a name="FNanchor_A_81" id="FNanchor_A_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_81" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> Of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>another weak man&mdash;Innocent X.&mdash;Velasquez painted
what Reynolds described as the greatest portrait he
saw in Rome; and it is truly one of the most amazing
life representations ever executed.<a name="FNanchor_B_82" id="FNanchor_B_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_82" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> A reddish face
peers out through a blaze of warm surroundings and
background; a face in full relief as if cut out of apoplectic
flesh&mdash;almost appalling in its verity. It is
like nothing else that Velasquez painted: it overpowers
with its combined strength and realism. But
it is a picture to see occasionally, and admire as a
great imitation. If one lived with it, the colour
would hurt the eye, the unpleasant face would tire the
mind. Such a face should not be painted: it should be
carved in stone, where truth may be given to form
without the protrusion of mortal decay. Bernini
sculptured the countenance, and gave the Pope a
certain majesty which no painting could present.
As a life portrait the work of Velasquez is unrivalled,
but as a pure work of art, it is behind the three portraits
of Philip IV. already mentioned. A distinctly
unhealthy face cannot be produced in portraiture
without injuring the art, for it is a variety of distortion.</p>

<p>Velasquez was so naturally a portraitist that apart
from his actual portrait work, every figure composition
he painted seems to consist merely of the portraits
of a group of persons. He took little pains to
connect the figures in a life action, often painting
them with a look of unconcern with the proceedings
around them, as if specially posing for the artist.
In several of his works there are faces looking right
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>out of the picture, and it is evident that in these the
artist had little thought in his mind away from portrait
presentation.<a name="FNanchor_A_83" id="FNanchor_A_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_83" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> The Surrender of Breda and
Las Meninas,<a name="FNanchor_B_84" id="FNanchor_B_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_84" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> regarded generally as his best compositions,
are admittedly portrait groupings, but the
setting in each case is one of action, and hence the
faces looking out of the picture are a great drawback,
as they disrobe the illusion of a natural scene. That
a man so accurate in his drawing, so perfect in his
chiaroscuro, and so skilful in his brushwork, should
yet be so conspicuously limited in imagination, is a
problem which art historians have yet to solve.</p>

<p>Franz Hals was on a level with Velasquez in respect
of facility in execution, and like him seems to
have been a born portraitist. His brushwork was so
rapid and decisive that in scarcely any of his designs
is there evidence of deliberation. He seems to have
been able to take in the essential features of a
subject at a glance, and to transfer them to canvas
without preliminaries, producing an amazing countenance
with the least possible detail. Though some of
his large groups are a little stiff, this is rather through
his want of capacity in invention than a set purpose
of exaggeration with a view to heightening the dignity
of pose, for it is obvious that Hals had little
imagination, and knew nothing of the boundless
possibilities of his art in general composition. He
appears to have passed through life without concern
for his work beyond material results, being well convinced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>that the magic of his execution would leave
nothing further for the public to desire. In the last
forty years of his life he made no advance in his art
except in one respect, but the change was great, for
it doubled the art value of his portraits. He learned
how to subordinate his colours; how to modify his
chiaroscuro in order to force the immediate attention
of the observer on the countenance of his subject.<a name="Eanchor_52" id="Eanchor_52"></a><a href="#Enote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
Such an advance with such an artist placed him in the
rank of the immortals among the portraitists.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the judgment of the greatest
painters, decoration in a portrait should be altogether
subordinated to the truthful representation of
character, this practice being only varied when the
personage portrayed is of public importance, and the
portrait is required more or less as a monument. The
rule is natural and reasonable, being based upon the
universal agreement that the all-important part of a
man comprehended by the vision is his countenance.
But the rule only strictly applies to a single figure
portrait, for when the painter goes beyond this, and
executes a double portrait or a multiple group, he
restricts the scope of his art. Other things being
equal a double portrait is necessarily inferior art to
a single figure picture, since the dual objective complicates
the impression of the work on the brain, and
the only remedy, or partial remedy, for this drawback
possessed by the painter is to introduce accessories
and arrange his group in a subject design.
This plan results in detracting from the force of the
actual portraits, as it divides the attention of the
observer, but there is no help for it unless one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
content with the representation of the figures in a
stiff and formal way which extinguishes the pictorial
effect of the work.</p>

<p>The greatest artists have avoided dual or triple
portrait works where possible except in cases of
gatherings of members of the same family, as one
of these groups may be regarded as a unity by the
observer. Nevertheless in his picture of Leo X., and
the two younger Medici,<a name="FNanchor_A_85" id="FNanchor_A_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_85" class="fnanchor">[v]</a> Raphael was careful to
subordinate the cardinals so that they should appear
little more than accessories in a painting of the Pope;
an example which was followed not quite so successfully
by Titian in his triple portrait of Paul III. with
the two brothers Farnese.<a name="FNanchor_B_86" id="FNanchor_B_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_86" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> A group of two persons
who are in some way associated with each other,
though unconnected in action, rarely looks out of
place, as in the pictures of father and son, or of two
brothers, painted by Van Dyck, or in The Ambassadors
of Holbein,<a name="FNanchor_C_87" id="FNanchor_C_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_87" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> but no painter has yet succeeded
in producing a first-class work of art out of a multiple
portrait group when the personages represented
are unconnected with each other, either directly in
action, or indirectly through association derived
from the title. The picture of Rubens representing
Lipsius and three others, would appear much more
stiff and formal than it is, without one of the two
titles given to it, notwithstanding the general excellence
of the composition.<a name="FNanchor_D_88" id="FNanchor_D_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_88" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> When the figures
introduced are very numerous, as in the many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>groups of civic organizations painted by Hals,
Ravesteyn, and others, the compulsory formality
seriously detracts from the &aelig;sthetic value of the
works, however superior they may be in execution,
or whatever the connection of the personages represented;
and when we come to such crowded paintings
as Terburg's Signing the Peace of M&uuml;nster,<a name="FNanchor_E_89" id="FNanchor_E_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_89" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> we
obtain but little more than a record, though it be
of absorbing historical interest.</p>

<p>It is observable that as a rule portraitists have been
more successful with delineations of men than of
women. This is to be accounted for by the necessity
for subordinating the representation of character to
the art in the case of women unless they have passed
the prime of life; while with men the art is usually
subordinated to the portrait, character being sought
independently of sensorial beauty. Strictly it is the
duty of the artist to make his portrait, whether of
a man or a woman, sensorially attractive, but here
again in portraiture custom and convention have to
be considered with the rules of art. It is agreed
that with a woman sensorial beauty must be produced
if that be possible, even with the sacrifice of
certain elements of character; but with a man the
portrait must be recognized by the acquaintances of
the subject as corresponding in most details with his
life appearance. The future of the portrait is out of
the question for the time being. Nevertheless the
painter has certain advantages in dealing with
the features of a man, for the presence of lines in
the brow, or other evidence of experience, does not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>interfere with the nobility or dignity which may be
added to his general bearing; but what would be lines
in the countenance of a man would be wrinkles in
that of a woman, because here they can scarcely be
neutralized by attitude and expression which imply
strength of character, without destroying what is
best described as womanly charm, which is a compulsory
feature in every woman's portrait. With
a man therefore the portraitist considers character
first and emphasizes qualities of form within his
power; while with a woman, during the period of her
bloom, beauty of form and feature must be the first
care of the artist, unconflicting qualities of character
being emphasized or added.</p>

<p>All this was of course recognized by the great portraitists
of the Renaissance and the seventeenth
century, but while most of them endeavoured to
enhance the sensorial beauty of their men subjects,
little attempt was made to add intellectual grace to
the portrayals of women. Antonio Moro<a name="FNanchor_A_90" id="FNanchor_A_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_90" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a> and Van
Dyck, in their full length portraits of women, sometimes
succeeded in converting dignity of form into
what we understand as grandeur, which implies
dignity of expression as well as grace and dignity of
form, but they were largely handicapped by the dress
fashions of their times. They had to deal with heavy
formal drapery which hung over the figures like
elongated bells, and bid defiance to freedom of pose.
When fashions and customs had so changed as to
allow of definition being given to the figures, Van
Dyck had been dead for many years. Meanwhile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Hals, Rembrandt, Velasquez, and hundreds of lesser
lights, were casting around their flowers of form and
mind, but all on the old plan, for it is difficult to find
a portrait of a woman painted during the century
succeeding Van Dyck, where beauty of feature is
allied to nobility in expression.</p>

</div>


<p>The production of this combination awaited the
maturity of Reynolds, who with Gainsborough,
broke into a new field in the portraiture of women.
Gainsborough took the grandeur of Van Dyck for his
pattern, but improved upon it by substituting simplicity
for dignity and elaboration, which he was
able to manage without great difficulty, as he had a
clear advantage over the Flemish master in that the
costumes in use in his time were lighter in character,
and permitted of the contour of form being properly
exhibited. This simple grace of form allied to
grandeur in bearing, naturally brings about an
apparent modification in expression in conformity
with it, so long as there are no conflicting elements
in expression present, which Gainsborough was
careful to avoid. Reynolds went further than
Gainsborough, for after the middle of his career he
directly added an expression of nobility to his portraits
of women whenever the features would admit
of it, and so brought about the highest type of feminine
portraiture known in art. He was more nearly
allied to Titian than Van Dyck, and though in sheer
force of sensorial beauty he did not reach the level of
the Venetian master, yet in pure feminine portraiture,
where high beauty of expression is combined with a
perfect generalization of the features, Reynolds is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>unsurpassed in the history of painting, so far as we
can judge from examples remaining to us. For we
must estimate an artist from his best work. Reynolds
painted forty or fifty portraits of women of
the character indicated, and a few of them, notably
Mrs. Siddons as Tragedy,<a name="FNanchor_A_91" id="FNanchor_A_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_91" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a> and Mrs. Billington as
St. Cecilia,<a name="FNanchor_B_92" id="FNanchor_B_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_92" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a> are amongst the most luminous examples
of feminine portraiture in existence. There are
many artists who equalled Reynolds in the representation
of men, but there are very few indeed who
even attempted to strike a just balance between
sensorial and intellectual effects in the countenance
of a woman.</p>

<p>With such great leaders as Reynolds and Gainsborough,
it might have been hoped that the school
they founded in portraiture would have taken a long
lease of life, but it rapidly died away, leaving very
few indeed of footsteps sunk deep in the sands of
glory, save those of Raeburn, Hoppner, Lawrence,
and Romney. But between Reynolds and Romney
there is a wide gulf, for while the former sought for
his beauty among the higher gifts of nature, Romney,
with rare exceptions, was content with a formal expression
allied to grace of pose. We may shortly
consider this graceful attitude for it seems to be often
regarded as an all-sufficing feature in the representation
of women.<a name="Eanchor_53" id="Eanchor_53"></a><a href="#Enote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>The charm of grace lies chiefly in movement, and a
graceful attitude in repose implies rest from graceful
movement, but this attitude is ephemeral in nature,
for if prolonged it quickly becomes an artificial pose.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>In art therefore, a graceful pose, whether exhibited
in action or at rest, must soon tire unless attractive
expression be present to deepen the impress of the
work upon the mind of the observer. The general
&aelig;sthetic value of graceful form in a painted figure
varies with the scale to which the figure is drawn.
With a heroic figure, grace is of the smallest importance;
in one of life size, as a portrait for instance, the
quality is of considerable assisting value; and as the
scale is diminished, so does the relative value of grace
increase. This is because details of expression can be
less truthfully rendered in small figures than in those
of life size, while in miniature figures certain high
qualities of expression, as nobility, or a combined
expression of mind and form, as grandeur, can be
scarcely indicated at all, so that purely sensorial
beauty, as that arising from grace of pose, becomes
of comparatively vast importance. This was well
understood in ancient times. The Grecian sculptured
life-size figures are nearly always graceful, but
the grace arises naturally from perfection of form and
expression, and not from a specially added quality, a
particular grace of pose being always subordinated,
if present at all. On the other hand, in the smaller
Grecian figures, such as those found at Tanagra and
in Asia Minor, anything in expression beyond regularity
of features is not attempted, but grace is
always present, and it is entirely upon this that the
beauty of the figurines depends. We may presume
from the frescoes opened out at Pompeii, that the
ancients were well aware of the value and limitations
of grace in art. In all these decorations where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
figures are of a general type, as fauns, bacchantes,
nereids, dancers, and so on, they are represented in
motion, flying drapery being skilfully used to provide
illusion. Grace is the highest quality evident in these
forms, while the expression is invariably negative.
For pure wall decorations, which are observed in a
casual way, a high quality of grace such as these
frescoes provide is all-sufficient, but as with the
Greeks, the Romans did not make grace a leading
feature in serious art.</p>

<p>With the great painters of the Renaissance, nobility,
grandeur, and general perfection of form and
expression, though necessarily implying a certain
grace in demeanour, altogether dwarfed the feature
of grace of pose. In the seventeenth century, grace
was subordinated to dignity of form in the case of
Van Dyck and Velasquez, and to actual life experience
with Rubens and Rembrandt. When either of
these last two added a quality of form to their
figures, it was always dignity and not grace. Murillo
was the first Spanish painter to pay particular attention
to the grace of his figures, but he never gave it
predominance. The French masters of the period,
Le Brun, Le Sueur, Poussin, Mignard, and Rigaud,
leaned too closely to classical traditions to permit of
grace playing a leading part in their designs, though
some of slightly lesser fame as Noel and Antoine
Coypel, appeared to attribute considerable value to
the quality. It was during this century in Italy that
grace first appeared as a prominent feature in figure
painting. In his pastoral and classical scenes, Albani
seems to have largely relied upon it for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
beauty, and Cignani, Andrea Sacchi, Sassoferrato,
and others followed in his footsteps in this respect,
though up to the end of the century no attempt was
made in portraiture to sacrifice other features to
grace of pose. Rosalba then made her appearance as
a portraitist, and she was the first to rest the entire
beauty of her work on sensorial charm of feature and
grace of pose. She developed a weakened school
in France which culminated with Nattier; and in
England, Angelica Kauffmann, and some miniature
painters, notably Cosway and Humphrey, took up
her system for their life-size portraits, while many
artists "in small" as Cipriani and Bartolozzi, assisted
in forming a cult of the style. But of the greater
British painters, only Romney gave high importance
to grace of pose in portraits of women. It is safer
for an artist to eschew grace of pose altogether than
to sacrifice higher qualities to it. A little added
dignity is always preferable to a graceful attitude in
a portrait, because in nature it is not so evanescent
a feature. Grace is a good assisting quality, but an
inferior substitute.</p>

<p>The greatest repose possible is necessary in a portrait,
as a suggestion of action tends to draw the
attention of the observer to it, thus impeding the
impression of the whole upon his mind. The leading
portraitists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
never erred in this matter, unless we except a
single work by Titian&mdash;the portrait group of Paul
III. and the Cardinals Farnese, where the last named
has just arrived and is apparently in the act of bowing
before completing his final step; but even here it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
may be fairly argued that a moment of rest between
two parts of the final action is to be presumed. It
was not an uncommon practice of Van Dyck to pose
a subject arrested in the act of walking, or with one
foot on the lowest step of a stairway as if about to
ascend; but in each of these instances the head is
turned, and it is obvious that the motion is temporarily
stayed.<a name="FNanchor_A_93" id="FNanchor_A_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_93" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a> A similar pose was sometimes
adopted by British artists of the eighteenth century
with conspicuous success. If a portrait figure be
painted in the act of walking on level ground, the
feet must be together even if the moment represented
be that between two steps in the action, because it is
contrary to all experience for a man to rest while so
walking, with one foot in front of the other. In a
general composition the representation of a man walking
with the feet separated is permissible, because it
is part of a general action, and accessory in its nature,
but in a portrait the beginning and end of the action
depicted are usually unknown, and hence any action
must be meaningless and disturbing to the observer.<a name="FNanchor_B_94" id="FNanchor_B_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_94" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a></p>

<p>The French and English artists of the eighteenth
century followed the practice of their predecessors in
avoiding the exhibition of movement in their portraits,
but occasionally they departed from the rule.
In his fine portrait of Mrs. Thomas Raikes, Romney
shows the lady playing a harpsichord, with the fingers
apparently in motion; and in his group of the Ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Spencer, one of them is fingering a harp. The result
in each case is a stiff attitude which detracts from
the beauty of the work. Van Dyck managed such
a design in a much better way, for in his portrait of
his wife with a cello, she holds the bow distinctly at
rest.<a name="FNanchor_A_95" id="FNanchor_A_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_95" class="fnanchor">[af]</a> Titian also, when representing a man at an
organ, shows his hands stayed, while turning his
head.<a name="FNanchor_B_96" id="FNanchor_B_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_96" class="fnanchor">[ag]</a> Reynolds moved aside once from the custom
in respect of action,<a name="FNanchor_C_97" id="FNanchor_C_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_97" class="fnanchor">[ah]</a> and Raeburn seems also to have
erred only on a single occasion.<a name="FNanchor_D_98" id="FNanchor_D_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_98" class="fnanchor">[ai]</a></p>

<h3>EXPRESSION. PART VI&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Grief&mdash;The smile&mdash;The open mouth&mdash;Contrasts&mdash;Representation
of death.</p>

<p>The painter has ever to be on his guard against
over-emphasis of facial expression. His first object
is to present an immediately intelligible composition,
and this being accomplished, much has already
been done towards providing appropriate expressions
for his characters. It has been seen that attitude
alone may appear to lend to a countenance suitable
expression which is not observed when the head of
the figure is considered separately; and while such
a condition is not frequent, its possibility indicates
that the painter is warranted in relying more or less
upon the details of his action for conveying the state
of mind of the personages concerned therein. It is
not the purpose here to deal with the various forms
of expression that may be of use to the painter, nor
indeed is it necessary. The work of Raphael alone
leaves little to be learned in respect of the expression
of emotion so far as it may be exhibited in a
painting<a name="Eanchor_54" id="Eanchor_54"></a><a href="#Enote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>; but there are a few matters in relation
to the subject which appear to require attention,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
judging from experience of modern painting, and
short notes upon them are here given.</p>


<h4><br />GRIEF</h4>

<p>Intense grief is the most difficult expression to
depict in the whole art of painting, because in nature
it usually results in distortion of the features, which
the artist must avoid at all cost. Of the thousands
of paintings of scenes relating to the Crucifixion,
where the Virgin is presumed to be in great agony
at the foot of the Cross, very rarely has an artist
attempted to portray this agony in realistic manner.<a name="FNanchor_A_99" id="FNanchor_A_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_99" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
He generally substitutes for grief an expression of
sorrow which is produced without contraction of
the features. This expression, which is invariably
accompanied with extreme pallor, does not prevent
the addition of a certain nobility to the countenance,
and hence no suggestion of insufficiency arises
in the mind of the observer. But the sublime expression
which may be given to the Virgin would be
out of place in her attendants who are not infrequently
made hideous through attempts to represent
them as overcome with grief.</p>


<p>A method of avoiding the difficulty is to conceal
the face of the personage presumed to be suffering
from grief. Timanthes is recorded by Pliny as
having painted a picture of the Sacrifice of Iphigenia
in which the head of Agamemnon was completely
covered by his robe; and a picture of the same sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ject
in a Pompeian fresco represents the Grecian
monarch hiding his face with his right hand, while
the left gathers up his robe.<a name="FNanchor_A_100" id="FNanchor_A_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_100" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> This invention was
the subject of considerable discussion in Europe
in the eighteenth century, in which Reynolds, Falconet,
Lessing, and others took part. Reynolds said
of the device that an artist might use it once, but if
he did so a second time, he would be justly suspected
of improperly evading difficulties. Falconet compared
the action of Timanthes to that of a poet who
avoided expressing certain sentiments on the ground
that the action of his hero was above anything that
could be said<a name="FNanchor_B_101" id="FNanchor_B_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_101" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>; while Lessing held that the grief
which overcame Agamemnon could only find expression
in distortion, and hence the artist was right
in covering the face.<a name="FNanchor_C_102" id="FNanchor_C_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_102" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> Unquestionably Lessing was
justified, for nothing more is demanded of the painter
than to impress the imagination of the observer with
the intensity of the grief depicted, and in this he
succeeds. Obviously the poet is in a different position
from the painter because he can express deep
grief easily enough without suggesting distortion of
the features.</p>

<p>The artifice of Timanthes was practically unused
during the Renaissance, though Botticelli once conceals
the face of a woman lamenting over the body
of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_A_103" id="FNanchor_A_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_103" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> and Richardson quotes a drawing by
Polidoro where the Virgin hides her face in drapery
in a lamentation scene. In Flanders at a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
earlier period, Roger van der Weyden used the device,<a name="FNanchor_B_104" id="FNanchor_B_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_104" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
and the Ma&icirc;tre de Fl&eacute;malle shows St. John
turning his head away and holding his hand to his
face in a Crucifixion scene.<a name="FNanchor_C_105" id="FNanchor_C_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_105" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> In the succeeding
centuries little was known of the practice, but quite
lately it has come into use again. Boecklin painted
a Piet&agrave; in which the Virgin has thrown herself
over the dead body of Christ in an agony of grief,
her whole form being covered by a cloak. Feuerbach
has a somewhat similar arrangement, and in
a picture of the Departure of Jason, he hides the
face of an attendant of Medea, a plan adopted in
two or three frescoes of the subject at Pompeii.
Prud'hon, in a Crucifixion scene, hides the face of the
Magdalene in her hands, and Kaulbach in his Marguerite
so bends her head that her face is completely
concealed from the observer. Where the face cannot
altogether be hidden owing to the character of the
design, it is sometimes thrown into so deep a shade
that the features are indistinguishable, this being
an excellent device for symbolical figures typifying
great anguish.<a name="FNanchor_D_106" id="FNanchor_D_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_106" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<p>It is not a good plan in a tragic design merely to
turn the head away to indicate grief or sorrow, because
in such a case the artist is unable to differentiate
between a person experiencing intense grief,
and one who turns his head from horror of the
tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_A_107" id="FNanchor_A_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_107" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> The scheme of half veiling the face is
not often successful, since the depth of emotion that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>would be presumed from such an action may be
more than counterbalanced by the very limited
feeling which can be indicated by the part of the
face remaining exposed. On account of a neutralizing
effect of this kind, Loefftz's fine picture of the
Dead Christ at Munich is much weakened, for there
is no stronger expression on the part of the Virgin
than patient resignation. Sorrow may well be displayed
by semi-concealment of the features, because
here the necessary expression may be produced by
the eyes alone.<a name="FNanchor_B_108" id="FNanchor_B_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_108" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> In ancient art, to half conceal the
face indicated discretion, as in the case of a Pompeian
fresco where a nurse of the young Neptune,
handing him over to a shepherd for education, has
her mouth and chin covered, the meaning of this
being that she is acquainted with the high birth of
the boy, but must not reveal it.</p>


<h4><br />THE SMILE</h4>

<p>A pronounced smile in nature is always transitory,
and hence should be avoided when possible
in a painting. The only smile that does not tire
is that which is so faint as to appear to be permanent
in the expression, and it has been the aim
of many painters to produce this smile. An examination
of numerous pictures where a smile is
expressed in the countenance has convinced the
writer that when either the eyes alone, or the eyes
and mouth together, are used to indicate a smile,
it is invariably over-pronounced as a suggestive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>permanent feature, and that in every case of such
permanence, success arises from work on the mouth
alone.</p>

<p>The permanent smile was not studied in Europe
till the Milanese school was founded, and in this
nearly every artist gave his attention to it, following
the example of Lionardo. This great master, who
was well acquainted with the principles of art, is
not likely to have had in his mind an evanescent
expression when he experimented with the smile,
and one can hardly understand therefore why this
feature is almost invariably over-emphasized in his
works. In his portrayal of women he used both
eyes and mouth to bring about the smile,<a name="FNanchor_A_109" id="FNanchor_A_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_109" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> and more
commonly than not paid most attention to the eyes.
Perhaps he had in view the production of a permanent
smile solely by means of the eyes, which
play so great a part in general expression. In nature
it is physically impossible for a smile to be produced
without a faint variation in the mouth line, while
the lower eyelids may remain perfectly free from
any change in light and shade, even with a smile
more pronounced than is necessary for apparent
permanence. In the Mona Lisa at Boston,<a name="Eanchor_56" id="Eanchor_56"></a><a href="#Enote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> the
smile is very faintly indicated by the eyes, and most
pronounced at the mouth, while in the famous Paris
picture, the eyes are chiefly responsible for the smile,
the mouth only slightly assisting.<a name="Eanchor_57" id="Eanchor_57"></a><a href="#Enote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Many smiling
faces were produced by others of the Milanese school,
and as a rule the mouth only was used, often with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
complete success, notably by B. Luini,<a name="FNanchor_B_110" id="FNanchor_B_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_110" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>
Pedrini,<a name="FNanchor_C_111" id="FNanchor_C_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_111" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
and Ferrari.<a name="FNanchor_D_112" id="FNanchor_D_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_112" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> Raphael never used the eyes to assist
in producing a smile, except with the Child Christ,<a name="FNanchor_E_113" id="FNanchor_E_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_113" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
and in all cases where he exhibits a smile in a Madonna<a name="FNanchor_F_114" id="FNanchor_F_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_114" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
or portrait,<a name="FNanchor_G_115" id="FNanchor_G_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_115" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> it appears definitely permanent.
As a rule the great artists of the Renaissance other
than the disciples of Lionardo, rarely produced a
smile with the intention of suggesting a permanently
happy expression, and in the seventeenth
century little attention was given to it.</p>

<p>The great French portraitists of the eighteenth
century frequently made the smile a feature in
expression, and a few of them, notably La Tour,
seldom produced a countenance without one. In
most cases the smile is a little too pronounced for
permanence, but there are many examples of a
faint and delicate smile which may well suggest an
habitual condition. Rigaud's Louis XV. as a Boy is
an instance,<a name="FNanchor_A_116" id="FNanchor_A_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_116" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> though here the illusion quickly passes
when we bring to mind the other portraits of the
monarch. Nattier,<a name="FNanchor_B_117" id="FNanchor_B_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_117" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Boucher,<a name="FNanchor_C_118" id="FNanchor_C_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_118" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Dumont le Romain,<a name="FNanchor_D_119" id="FNanchor_D_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_119" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
Perronneau,<a name="FNanchor_E_120" id="FNanchor_E_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_120" class="fnanchor">[v]</a> Chardin, Roslin, and others, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>succeeded, but the French master of the smile was
La Tour who executed quite a dozen examples which
Lionardo might have envied.<a name="FNanchor_F_121" id="FNanchor_F_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_121" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> Of British artists
Romney was the most adept in producing a permanent
smile,<a name="FNanchor_G_122" id="FNanchor_G_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_122" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> but strange to say there is no instance
of one in his many portraits of Lady Hamilton,
beyond her representation as a bacchante.<a name="FNanchor_H_123" id="FNanchor_H_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_123" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Here
the smile is far too pronounced for a plain portrait,
but a bacchante may reasonably be supposed to be
ever engaged in scenes of pleasure, and hence the
feature does not seem to be out of place. Reynolds
commonly used both eyes and mouth in creating
his smiles,<a name="FNanchor_I_124" id="FNanchor_I_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_124" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> but Raeburn was nearly equal to Romney
in the number of his felicitous smiles, while he
seldom exceeded the minimum expression required
for permanence.<a name="FNanchor_J_125" id="FNanchor_J_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_125" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a> Gainsborough produced a few
portraits of women with a vague furtive smile, sweet
and expressive beyond degree.<a name="FNanchor_K_126" id="FNanchor_K_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_126" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a> They are invariably
brought about by a faint curvature of the mouth line.</p>


<h4><br />THE OPEN MOUTH</h4>

<p>If there be one transient feature more than another
which should be avoided in a painting, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>particularly in the principal figure, it is a wide-open
mouth. Necessarily, after a short acquaintance
with a picture containing such a feature, either the
mouth appears to be kept open by a wedge, or, as
in the case of a laugh, the face is likely to wear an
abnormal expression approaching to idiocy, for it is
altogether contrary to experience of normal persons
in real life, for a mouth to be kept open longer than
for an instant or two. Hence the first artists have
studiously refrained from exhibiting a wide-open
mouth, or indeed one that is open at all except to
such an extent that the parted lips appear a permanent
condition. But a few great men have erred
in the matter. Thus, Mantegna shows the child
Christ with the mouth widely open in a half-vacant
and half-startled expression, which is immediately
repelling.<a name="FNanchor_A_127" id="FNanchor_A_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_127" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a> Dosso Dossi has several pictures much
injured by the feature,<a name="FNanchor_B_128" id="FNanchor_B_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_128" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a> and in Ercole di Roberti's
Concert, no less than three mouths are wide open.<a name="FNanchor_C_129" id="FNanchor_C_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_129" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a>
One of the figures in Velasquez's Three Musicians
opens his mouth far too widely,<a name="FNanchor_D_130" id="FNanchor_D_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_130" class="fnanchor">[af]</a> while Hals has half
a dozen pictures with the defect.<a name="FNanchor_E_131" id="FNanchor_E_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_131" class="fnanchor">[ag]</a> A rare mistake
was made by Carlo Dolci when showing Christ with
His mouth open wide in the act of utterance,<a name="FNanchor_F_132" id="FNanchor_F_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_132" class="fnanchor">[ah]</a> and
Mengs erred similarly in St. John Baptist Preaching.<a name="FNanchor_G_133" id="FNanchor_G_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_133" class="fnanchor">[ai]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
In more modern times the fault is seldom noticeable
among artists of repute, though occasionally a bad
example occurs, as in Winslow Homer's All's Well.<a name="FNanchor_H_134" id="FNanchor_H_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_134" class="fnanchor">[aj]</a>
Even when an open mouth seems unavoidable, the
effect is by no means neutralized.<a name="FNanchor_I_135" id="FNanchor_I_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_135" class="fnanchor">[ak]</a></p>

</div>



<p>When the blemish is in an accessory figure, it is of
lesser importance as there it becomes an incidental
circumstance on the mind of the observer. Thus,
in Reynolds's Infant Hercules, where Alcmena,
on seeing the child holding the snakes, opens her
mouth with surprise and alarm, the action of the
central figure is so strong that the importance of
the others present is comparatively insignificant.<a name="FNanchor_C_136" id="FNanchor_C_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_136" class="fnanchor">[al]</a>
Nevertheless in a Pompeian fresco of the same
subject, care has been taken to close the mouth
of Alcmena. Where the design represents several
persons singing, it is well possible to indicate the
action without showing the mouths open, as in
Raphael's St. Cecilia.<a name="FNanchor_D_137" id="FNanchor_D_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_137" class="fnanchor">[am]</a> In a picture of a like subject,
with the Saint in the centre of a group of five
singers, Domenichino shows only the two outside
figures with open mouths, and one of these is in
profile. There are several works where David is
seen singing to the accompaniment of a harp, but
though his mouth is open, the figure is in profile,
and the lips are hidden by moustache and beard.<a name="FNanchor_E_138" id="FNanchor_E_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_138" class="fnanchor">[an]</a></p>

<p>It may be observed, however, that in certain cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
artificial conditions may render an open mouth in
a picture of comparatively little significance. A
painted laugh for instance may only become objectionable
to the observer when the work is constantly
before him; but when it is in a picture
gallery and he sees it but rarely, the lasting character
of the feature is not presented to his mind. The
Laughing Cavalier of Franz Hals, though violating
the principle, does not appear in bad taste to the
average visitor to the Wallace Collection. In the
case of Rembrandt's portrait of himself with Saskia
on his knee, where the artist has his lips parted in
the act of laughing, there is an additional reason why
the transient expression should not tire. Because
of the number of self-portraits he painted, the countenance
of Rembrandt is quite familiar to most
picture gallery visitors, and to these the laugh in
the Dresden picture could not possibly pass as an
habitual expression.</p>


<h4><br />CONTRASTS</h4>

<p>Designs specially built up for the purpose of contrasting
two or more attributes or conditions are
almost invariably uninteresting unless the motive
be hidden behind a definite action which appears
to control the scheme. This is because of the
difficulty of otherwise connecting the personages
contrasted in a particular action of common
understanding. A design of Hercules and Omphale
affords a superior contrast of strength and beauty
to a composition of Strength and Wisdom. In each
case a herculean figure and a lovely woman represent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the respective qualities, but in the first the figures
are connected by expression and action, and in the
second no connection can be established. So in
contrasting beauty of mind with that of form, this
is much better represented by such a subject as
Hippocrates and the Bride of Perdiccas than in the
Venetian manner of figures unconnected in the design.
And in respect of conditions, Frith's picture
of Poverty and Wealth, where a carriage full of
fashionable women drives through a poor section
of London, has little more than a topographical
interest, but in a subject such as The First Visit of
Cr&#339;sus to &AElig;sop, the contrast between poverty and
wealth would deeply strike the imagination.</p>

<p>In contrasts of good and evil, vice and virtue, and
similar subjects, it is inferior art to represent the
evil character by an ugly figure. As elsewhere
pointed out, deformity of any kind injures the &aelig;sthetic
value of a picture because it tends to neutralize
the pleasurable feeling derived from the beauty
present. The poet may join physical deformity
with beauty because he can minimize the defect
with words, but the painter has no such recourse.<a name="Eanchor_58" id="Eanchor_58"></a><a href="#Enote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
A deformed personage in a composition is therefore
to be deprecated unless as a necessary accessory in
a historical work, in which case he must be subordinated
to the fullest extent possible. The figure of
Satan, of an exaggerated satyr type, has often been
introduced into subjects such as the Temptation
of Christ, though not by artists of the first rank.<a name="FNanchor_A_139" id="FNanchor_A_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_139" class="fnanchor">[ao]</a>
Such pictures do not live as high class works of art
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>however they be painted. Correggio makes a contrast
of Vice and Virtue in two paintings,<a name="FNanchor_B_140" id="FNanchor_B_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_140" class="fnanchor">[ap]</a> representing
Vice by a man bound, but usually in the
mature time of the Renaissance, Vice was shown as
a woman, either beautiful in features, or with her
face partly hidden, various accessories indicating
her character. A notable exception is Salviati's
Justice where a hideous old woman takes the r&ocirc;le
of Vice.<a name="FNanchor_C_141" id="FNanchor_C_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_141" class="fnanchor">[aq]</a> Even in cases where a witch has to be
introduced, as in representations of Samuel's Curse,
it is not necessary to follow the example of Salvator
Rosa, and render her with deformed features, for
there are several excellent works where this defect
is avoided.<a name="FNanchor_D_142" id="FNanchor_D_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_142" class="fnanchor">[ar]</a></p>

<p>An effective design with the purpose of contrasting
the ages of man is not possible, firstly, because the
number of ages represented must be very limited,
and, secondly, for the reason that the figures cannot
be connected together in a free and easy manner.
Hence all such pictures have been failures, though a
few great artists have attempted the subject. Titian
tried it with two children, a young couple, and an
old man, assorting the personages casually in a landscape
without attempting to connect them together
in action.<a name="FNanchor_A_143" id="FNanchor_A_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_143" class="fnanchor">[as]</a> At about the same time Lotto produced
a contrast, also with three ages represented, namely,
a boy, a young man, and an elderly man.<a name="FNanchor_B_144" id="FNanchor_B_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_144" class="fnanchor">[at]</a> These
personages sit together as if they had been photographed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>for the purpose, without a ray of intelligence
passing between them. But this is far better
than Grien's Three Ages,<a name="FNanchor_C_145" id="FNanchor_C_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_145" class="fnanchor">[au]</a> for here the artist has
strangely confused life and death, exhibiting a grown
maiden, a middle-aged woman, and a skin-coated
skeleton holding an hour-glass. The best design of
the subject is Van Dyck's Four Ages.<a name="FNanchor_D_146" id="FNanchor_D_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_146" class="fnanchor">[av]</a> He shows
a child asleep near a young woman who is selling
flowers to a soldier, and an old man is in the background.
There is thus a presumed connection between
three of the personages, but naturally the
composition is somewhat stiff. The only other design
worth mentioning is by Boecklin, who also
represents four ages.<a name="FNanchor_E_147" id="FNanchor_E_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_147" class="fnanchor">[aw]</a> Two children play in the
background of a landscape; a little farther back
is a young woman; then a cavalier on horseback;
and finally on the top of an arch an old man whom
Death in the form of a skeleton is about to strike.
But here again there is no connection between the
figures, the consequent formality half destroying the
&aelig;sthetic value of the work. From these examples
than which there is none better, it may be gauged
that it is hopeless to expect a good design from a
subject where the ages of man are contrasted. If
represented at all, the ages should be contrasted in
separate pictures, as Lancret painted them.</p>

<p>The practice of presenting nude with clothed
figures where the subject does not absolutely compel
it, is commonly supposed to be for the purpose of
contrast. This may have been the object in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>cases, but in very few is the interest in the contrast
not outweighed by the bizarre appearance of the
work. As a rule in these pictures there is nothing
in the expressions or actions of the personages depicted
to suggest a reason for the absence of clothes
from some of them, and so to the average observer
they form a "problem" class of painting. The first
important work of the kind executed was Sebastiano
del Piombo's Concert, in which the group consists
of two nude women, one with a reed pipe, and two
men attired in Venetian costume, of whom one
handles a guitar.<a name="FNanchor_A_148" id="FNanchor_A_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_148" class="fnanchor">[ax]</a> The figures are very beautiful
and the landscape is superb, but as one cannot
account for the nude figures in an open-air musical
party, the &aelig;sthetic value of the work is largely
diminished. This painting has suggested several
designs to modern artists, the most notable being
Manet's D&eacute;jeuner sur l'Herbe, where a couple of
nude women with two men dressed in modern clothes
are shown in a picnic on the grass. Not only is the
scheme inexplicable, but the invention is so extravagant
as to provoke the lowest of suggestions.
In a composition of this kind only a great artist
can build up a harmonious design.</p>

<p>Titian's picture known as Sacred and Profane
Love,<a name="FNanchor_B_149" id="FNanchor_B_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_149" class="fnanchor">[ay]</a> where the figure of a nude woman is opposed
to one clothed, may really signify any of a dozen
ideas, but the artist probably had no other scheme
in his mind than to represent different types of
beautiful women. Crowe and Cavalcaselli's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>suggested title of L'Amour ing&eacute;nu et l'Amour satisfait,
was certainly never conceived by Titian, nor is
Burckhardt's proposal, Love and Prudery, possible
in view of the flowers in the hand of the draped
figure. In any case this picture is the greatest of
its kind, for the composition is so delicate and harmonious,
and the art so perfect, as to render its
precise meaning a matter of little consideration.
Another picture of Sacred and Profane Love was
painted by Grien.<a name="FNanchor_C_150" id="FNanchor_C_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_150" class="fnanchor">[az]</a> He shows a nude woman from
whom Cupid has just drawn the drapery, and another
woman concealing her figure with loose drapery.
The effect is weak. The nude figures in the well-known
Drinkers of Velasquez<a name="FNanchor_D_151" id="FNanchor_D_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_151" class="fnanchor">[ba]</a> are undisturbing because
they are not very prominent in the picture,
but their significance is not apparent.</p>

<p>No one has yet properly explained the meaning
of the nude male figures standing at ease in
the background of Michelangelo's celebrated Holy
Family.<a name="FNanchor_C_152" id="FNanchor_C_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_152" class="fnanchor">[bb]</a> They are apparently pagan gods, and it
is suggested that the artist intended to signify the
overthrow of the Grecian deities by the coming of
Christ. Such an explanation might be possible with
another painter, but it does not accord with our conception
of the mind of Michelangelo. A still greater
puzzle is offered by Luca Signorelli who, in the landscape

<h4><br />THE REPRESENTATION OF DEATH</h4>

<p>Death is a subject inappropriate to the art of
painting except where it is dealt with symbolically
or as an historical incident. Naturally in either of
these cases any realistic representation of death, or
of distortion connected therewith, should be studiously
avoided. For while many aspects of death
may not be unpleasant to the senses, its actual presence&mdash;the
cold immobility; the pulseless soulless,
decaying thing; the appalling mirror of our own
fate&mdash;these things are most unpleasant, and hence
should have no place in painting. In sculpture,
represented in a certain way, death is admissible,
for in marble or bronze a body may be carved indicating
only the eternal composure of a beautiful
form. This is how the Greeks showed death,
whether in the case of a warrior fallen on the battlefield,
or as the twin brother of Sleep. But the
painter is less fortunate: for him death is decay.</p>

<p>The presence of so many scenes of death in the
paintings of the past was the result of accident. For
a long while after the dawn of the Renaissance, those
controlling churches and other religious institutions
of the Christians were the chief and almost the only
patrons of art, and they required paintings as well
for didactic purposes as for decoration. For some
time pictures often took the place of writing, where
comparatively few could read, in the inculcation
of Christian doctrines and history, and they were
largely used as images before which people could
kneel in prayer. The most important facts bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
upon Christian faith are concerned with death, and
so there have been accumulated thousands of paintings
of scenes of the Crucifixion, the death-beds of
saints, instances of martyrdom, and so on. While
these paintings have been highly useful as tending
to invite reverence for a sublime creed, it would be
injurious to suggest that generally they take a high
place in art. Some of them do, but the very large
number of them which indicate dying agony, or
recent death with all its mortal changes, must not
be approved from a strict art point of view, for any
beauty which may be present apart from the subject
is instantly neutralized by the pain and horror
arising from the invention. But it is evidently
unnecessary to produce such pictures, even in the
case of the Crucifixion, for there are ample works in
existence to show that the face and body of Christ
can be so presented as to be free from indications
of physical suffering or decay.</p>

<p>But if we are to protest against designs exhibiting
forbidding aspects of death in sacred works, what
can we say of the pictures of executions, massacres,
plagues, and so on, which ever and again have been
produced since the middle of the nineteenth century?
Deeds of heroism or self-sacrifice on the battlefield
where bodies of the fallen may be outlined are well,
but simple wholesale murders as presented by Benjamin-Constant,
Heim, and fifty others, where the
motive does not pretend to be anything else than
massacre or other ghastly event, can only live as
examples of degraded art. There may be something
said for Verestchagin, who painted heaps of heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and skulls, and scattered corpses, in order to show
the evils of war, but if the arts are to be used at all
for such a purpose, the poet or orator would be much
more impressive because he could veil the hideous
side of the subject with pathos and imagery, and
further differentiate between just and unjust wars.
The painter is powerless to do these things. He can
only represent the horrors of war by depicting horrible
things which is entirely beyond the province
of his art. The purpose of art is to give pleasure,
and if the design descend below the line where
displeasure begins, then the art is no more.</p>

<p>How easy it is for the &aelig;sthetic value of a picture
to be lowered by the representation of a corpse, is
shown in three celebrated paintings&mdash;the anatomical
works of Rembrandt<a name="FNanchor_A_154" id="FNanchor_A_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_154" class="fnanchor">[bd]</a>
and De Keyser.<a name="FNanchor_B_155" id="FNanchor_B_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_155" class="fnanchor">[be]</a> Probably
these works were ordered to honour the surgeons or
schools concerned, but the object would have been
better served by a composition such as Eakin's
Dr. Cross's Surgical Clinic.<a name="FNanchor_C_156" id="FNanchor_C_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_156" class="fnanchor">[bf]</a> Here the leading figure
is also giving a lesson to students, and practical
demonstration is proceeding, but there is no skeleton
or corpse to damage the picture. Fromentin said
that the Tulp work left him very cold,<a name="FNanchor_D_157" id="FNanchor_D_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_157" class="fnanchor">[bg]</a> and although
he endeavoured to find technical ground for this,
it is more than likely that the principal reason
lay in the involuntary mental disturbance brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>about by the corpse. Another fine design largely
injured by corporeal evidence of death is Ingres's
&#338;dipus and the Sphinx,<a name="FNanchor_E_158" id="FNanchor_E_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_158" class="fnanchor">[bh]</a> where a foot rises out of
a hole in the rock near the Sphinx, the presumption
of course being that the body of a man who had
failed with the riddle had lately been thrown there.
The invention is most deplorable in such a picture.</p>

<p>The use of a skeleton as a symbol of death in
painting seems to have been unusual during the
Renaissance till towards the end of the fifteenth
century. The earliest artist of note in this period
to adopt it, was Jean Prevost who represented a
man taking a letter from a skeleton without seeing
the messenger.<a name="FNanchor_B_159" id="FNanchor_B_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_159" class="fnanchor">[bi]</a> Then came Grien who painted
three works of the kind. In the first Death holds
an hour-glass at the back of a woman, and points
to the position of the sand<a name="FNanchor_C_160" id="FNanchor_C_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_160" class="fnanchor">[bj]</a>; in the second the
bony figure has clutched a girl by the hair<a name="FNanchor_D_161" id="FNanchor_D_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_161" class="fnanchor">[bk]</a>; and the
third represents a skeleton apparently kissing a girl.<a name="FNanchor_E_162" id="FNanchor_E_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_162" class="fnanchor">[bl]</a>
They are all hideous works, and might well have
acted as a warning to succeeding artists. After
Grien the use of a skeleton in design was practically
confined to the smaller German masters till the
middle of the second half of the sixteenth century,
when it disappeared from serious work. From this
time on, for the next three centuries artists of repute
rarely introduced a skeleton into a painting, though
it is to be found occasionally in engravings. One
might have supposed that the unsightly form had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>been abandoned with the imps, evil spirits, and other
crudities of past days, but it was not to be. The
search for novelties in recent times has only resulted
in the resuscitation of bygone eccentricities, and we
must not be surprised that the skeleton is amongst
them.</p>

<p>Modern artists have displayed considerable ingenuity
in the use of the skeleton, but the results
have necessarily only succeeded in degrading the
art. Rethel figures a skeleton in the costume of a
monk who is ringing a bell at a dance.<a name="FNanchor_A_163" id="FNanchor_A_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_163" class="fnanchor">[bm]</a> Several of
the dancers have fallen dead, apparently from plague,
and the whole scene is ghastly. Henneberg has a
Fortune allegory in which Death is about to seize
a horseman who is chasing a nude woman,<a name="FNanchor_B_164" id="FNanchor_B_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_164" class="fnanchor">[bn]</a> this
design being a slight modification of a variety of
prints executed in the sixteenth century. Thoma
uses a skeleton in a most bizarre manner. He substitutes
it for the serpent in a picture of Adam and
Eve,<a name="FNanchor_C_165" id="FNanchor_C_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_165" class="fnanchor">[bo]</a>
and in another work associates it with Cupid.<a name="FNanchor_D_166" id="FNanchor_D_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_166" class="fnanchor">[bp]</a>
Two lovers are talking, and Death stands behind
the woman whose hat Cupid is lifting. A terrible
picture with a political bearing was painted by Uhde.<a name="FNanchor_E_167" id="FNanchor_E_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_167" class="fnanchor">[bq]</a>
It represents a crowd of revolutionists rushing towards
a bridge, while a skeleton in modern costume
waves a sword and cheers them on. These instances
suffice to indicate the difficulty in the production of
a fine work of art with so hideous a form as a skeleton
thrown into prominence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>How simply one may avoid the introduction of a
skeleton in a design concerned with death, is shown
by an example where three artists deal with the same
motive&mdash;Death, the Friend. The first composition
shows an old man sitting dead in a chair while a
skeleton costumed as a monk, tolls a bell<a name="FNanchor_A_168" id="FNanchor_A_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_168" class="fnanchor">[br]</a>: in the
second there is also an old man in a chair, but an
Angel with a scythe is substituted for the skeleton<a name="FNanchor_B_169" id="FNanchor_B_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_169" class="fnanchor">[bs]</a>:
in the third an Angel with huge folded wings forming
an oval framework for her figure, leans over the
body of a child which has its face hidden.<a name="FNanchor_C_170" id="FNanchor_C_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_170" class="fnanchor">[bt]</a> The
second design is a vast improvement over the first,
but the third is incomparably the best of the three.
It may be remarked that a scythe is too trivial
an emblem for the Angel of Death, for whom
indeed an emblem of any kind is only admissible
when Death is represented as the result of
eternal justice, in which case a flaming sword is
appropriate.</p>

<p>Very rarely indeed can a good picture be made out
of a funeral scene. Such a scene attending the death
of a great man may be fitly produced, so long as
the imagination can be used in the composition;
that is to say, if there are few or no records of the
actual funeral<a name="FNanchor_A_171" id="FNanchor_A_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_171" class="fnanchor">[bu]</a>; but paintings relating to the modern
burial of unnamed persons are of little value as works
of art, for the imagination of the artist cannot extend
beyond unpleasant prosaic incidents of common
acquaintance. The purpose of the funeral scenes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of Courbet<a name="FNanchor_B_172" id="FNanchor_B_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_172" class="fnanchor">[bv]</a>
and Anne Ancher<a name="FNanchor_C_173" id="FNanchor_C_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_173" class="fnanchor">[bw]</a>
has never been explained;
and the various interiors, each with a coffin
and distracted relatives of the dead, by
Wiertz,<a name="FNanchor_D_174" id="FNanchor_D_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_174" class="fnanchor">[bx]</a>
Dalsgaard,<a name="FNanchor_E_175" id="FNanchor_E_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_175" class="fnanchor">[by]</a>
and other modern artists, are capable of bringing
only misery instead of pleasure to the observer.</p>

<p>But while funerals are unsuitable for the painter,
interior scenes where death has occurred and friends
are watching the body, offer special inducements to
artists, because the perfect stillness of the living
persons represented may be properly assumed, and
so the illusion of life is little likely to be disturbed
through the non-completion of an indicated action.
On this account these works appear very impressive
when well executed, and they may take high rank
even when the artist is limited in his scope by the
conditions of an actual scene. Very little is required
however to destroy the illusion of continuity. In
Kampf's picture of the lying-in-state of William I.,<a name="FNanchor_E_176" id="FNanchor_E_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_176" class="fnanchor">[bz]</a>
where many watchers are shown who are presumed
to be motionless, a boy in the middle distance in the
act of walking, is a most disturbing element. An
example where an illusion of continuity is perfectly
maintained is Orchardson's Borgia, where C&aelig;sar
Borgia stands in contemplation over the body of
his poisoned victim. The silence indicated appears
practically as permanent as the painted design, for
any reasonable time spent by the observer in examining
the picture, is not likely to be longer than
that during which C&aelig;sar may be presumed to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>remained still at the actual occurrence. Scenes of
approaching death may be arranged to produce a
similar illusion, as for instance where those present
are praying, or a single figure is waiting for the life
to pass from the sick person.</p>

</div>

<p>Little attention has been paid in art to the expression
of dying persons. There are many pictures
representing celebrated men and women in their
dying moments, but very few of them exhibit an
expression of noble resignation and fearlessness,
qualities which are naturally associated with a great
man as his end draws near. No doubt the artist is
often limited in his invention by the actual circumstances
of the death scene, as in Copley's Death
of Chatham,<a name="FNanchor_A_177" id="FNanchor_A_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_177" class="fnanchor">[ca]</a> for the statesman was unconscious at
the moment of representation. Other than this the
best known works of the kind relate to the death
of Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_B_178" id="FNanchor_B_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_178" class="fnanchor">[cb]</a> Queen Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_C_179" id="FNanchor_C_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_179" class="fnanchor">[cc]</a>
and General Wolfe.<a name="FNanchor_D_180" id="FNanchor_D_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_180" class="fnanchor">[cd]</a>
In the last instance only is there a fine expression.
How it was that Rubens missed his opportunity
with Seneca is hard to understand. The presence
of a clerk taking down the utterances of a philosopher
as he bleeds to death, gives the design a theatrical
appearance, and removes any suggestion of unconcerned
resignation which might have arisen. One of
the most powerful designs in existence relating to
approaching death, is a sculptured figure in bronze
of Hercules contemplating death.<a name="FNanchor_E_181" id="FNanchor_E_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_181" class="fnanchor">[ce]</a> The demi-god
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>is represented standing on an altar. His left foot
is raised upon the skull of an ox; his head is slightly
bent, and the whole attitude suggests a few moments
of rest while he contemplates his coming fate. The
conception is as fine as the subject is rare.</p>

<p>The artist should glorify death if possible, but he
can only do this when the subject has a general
application. Many painters have introduced the
Angel of Death into scenes where death has occurred,
and have thus converted them into work of pathos
and beauty. Notable examples of this are Watts's
Death, the Friend, already referred to, and H. Levy's
Young Girl and Death, where the Angel gently
clasps the body of a girl whose face is hidden. One
of the finest designs of the kind is Lard's Glory
Forgets not Obscure Heroes. On a battlefield, where
all else has gone, lies the body of a soldier over whom
stoops a lovely winged figure who raises the head of
the hero, and seems to throw a halo of glory over
him.<a name="FNanchor_A_182" id="FNanchor_A_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_182" class="fnanchor">[cf]</a> In historical paintings the appearance of
sleep is often given to a dead body, as in Cogniet's
Tintoretto Painting his Dead Daughter, a pathetic
picture, bringing to mind the story of Luca Signorelli
painting his dead son.<a name="FNanchor_B_183" id="FNanchor_B_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_183" class="fnanchor">[cg]</a></p>

<h3>LANDSCAPE</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Limitations of the landscape painter&mdash;Illusion of opening distance&mdash;Illusion
of motion in landscape&mdash;Moonlight scenes&mdash;Transient
conditions.</p>


<p>Considered as a separate branch of the painter's
art, landscape is on a comparatively low plane, because
the principal signs with which it deals, and
the arrangement of them to form a view, may be
varied indefinitely without a sense of incongruity
arising. Thus there can be no ideal in the art; that
is to say, no ideal can be conceived which is general
in its character. The artist can aspire to no definite
goal: his imagination is limited to the arrangement
of things which are inanimate and expressionless.
He may produce sensorial, but not intellectual,
beauty. The nobler human attributes and passions,
as wisdom, courage, spiritual exaltation, patriotism,
cannot be connected with landscape, and so it is
unable to produce in the mind the elevation of
thought and grandeur of sentiment which are the
sweetest blossoms of the tree of art.<a name="Eanchor_60" id="Eanchor_60"></a><a href="#Enote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Another drawback in landscape is the necessity
for painting it on an extraordinarily reduced scale.
Because of this the highest qualities of beauty in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
nature&mdash;grandeur and sublimity&mdash;can only with
difficulty be suggested on canvas, for actual magnitude
is requisite for the production of either of these
qualities in any considerable degree. A volcano in
eruption has no force at all in a painting, a result
which is due, not so much to the inability of the
painter to represent moving smoke and fire, as to
the impossibility of depicting their enormous masses.
The disability of the painter in respect of the representation
of magnitude is readily seen in the case of
a cathedral interior. This may or may not have the
quality of grandeur, but a picture cannot differentiate
between one that has, and one that has not,
because no feeling of grandeur can arise in looking
at a painted interior, the element of actual space
being absent.</p>

<p>Seeing that an ideal in landscape is impossible,
the landscape painter cannot improve upon nature.
In the case of the human figure the painter may
improve upon experience by collecting excellencies
from different models and putting them into one
form, thus creating what would be universally regarded
as ideal physical beauty; and he may give
to this form an expression of spiritual nobility which
is also beyond experience because it would imply
the absence of inferior qualities inseparable from
man in nature. Thus to the physical, he adds intellectual
beauty. Such a perfect form may be said
to be an improvement upon nature, for it is not
only beyond experience, but is nature purified. But
the landscape painter cannot improve upon the signs
which nature provides. He may vary the parts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
a tree as he will, but it would never be recognized
as beyond possible experience unless it were a monstrosity.<a name="Eanchor_61" id="Eanchor_61"></a><a href="#Enote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
And even if he could improve upon
experience with his signs, this would help him but
little, for the beauty of a landscape depends upon the
relation of the signs to each other, and not upon the
beauty of the separate signs which vary in every
work with the character of the design. In colour also
the painter cannot apply to his landscape an appropriate
harmony which the sun is incapable of giving.
From all this it follows that the &aelig;sthetic value of a
landscape depends entirely upon its correspondence
with nature.</p>

<p>A good landscape must necessarily be invented,
because it is impossible to reproduce the particular
beauty of a natural scene.<a name="Eanchor_62" id="Eanchor_62"></a><a href="#Enote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> This beauty is due to
a relation of parts of the view, infinite in number, to
each other, but what this relation is cannot be determined
by the observer. Further, whatever be the
relation, the continuous changing light and atmospheric
effects bring about a constant variation in
the character of the beauty. It is possible for an
actual view to suggest to the artist a scheme for a
beautiful landscape, but in this the precise relation
of the parts would have to be invented by the painter
and fixed by experiment. The principal features
from a natural view may be taken out, but not
those which together bring about the beauty. There
is no great landscape in existence which was painted
for the purpose of representing a particular view.
There have of course been scenes painted to order,
even by notable artists, but these only serve the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
purpose of record, or as mementoes. The great
view of The Hague, painted by Van Goyen under
instructions from the syndics of the town, is the
feeblest of his works, and the many pictures of
the kind executed by British and German artists of
the eighteenth century have now only a topographical
interest. Constable painted numerous scenes to
order, and there are something like forty views
of Salisbury Cathedral attributed to him, but only
those in which he could apply his own invention
are of considerable &aelig;sthetic value. A good artist
rarely introduces into a painting even a small sketch
of a scene made from nature. Titian is known to
have drawn numerous sketches in particular localities,
but not one has been identified in his pictures.
In nearly every painting of Nicholas Poussin the
Roman Campagna may be recognized, and here he
must have made thousands of sketches during the
forty years he spent in the district, yet the most
patient examination has failed to identify a single
spot in his many beautiful views. So with Gaspar
Poussin, who, unlike his famous brother-in-law, occasionally
set up his easel in the open air; and with
Claude who never left off sketching in his long life.
The greatest landscapes are those which are true
to nature generally, but are untrue in respect of
any particular natural scene.</p>

<p>Seeing that in landscape the production of sensorial
beauty only is within the power of the painter,
and that the beauty is enhanced as nature is the
more closely imitated, it is obvious that for the work
to have a permanent interest, the scene depicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and the incidents therein should be of common
experience, otherwise the full recognition of the
beauty is likely to be retarded by the reasoning
powers being involuntarily set to work in the consideration
of the exceptional conditions. Naturally
the term "common experience" has a varied application.
What is of common experience in scenery
among people in a temperate climate, is rare or
unknown to those living under the burning sun of
Africa. The artist is fully aware of this, and in
designing his work he takes into account the experience
of the people who are likely to see his paintings.
A view of a scene in the East, say in Palestine or
Siam, may be a beautiful work and be recognized as
true because the conditions depicted are commonly
known to exist; it would further have an informative
value which would result in added pleasure; but
among people habituated to a temperate climate it
would tire more quickly than a scene of a kind to
which they are daily accustomed. In the one case
an effort, however slight, is required to accommodate
the view to experience, and in the other the whole
meaning of the scene is instantaneously identified
with its beauty.</p>

<p>In nature there is always movement and sound.
Even on those rare days when the wind has ceased
and the air seems still and dead, there is motion
with noise of some kind. A brook trickles by,
insects buzz their zigzag way, and shadows vary as
the sun mounts or descends. But most commonly
there is a breeze to rustle the trees and shrubs, to
ripple the surface of the water, and to throw over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the scene evidence of life in its ever charming variety.
The painter cannot reproduce these movements and
sounds. All he represents is silent and still as if
nature had suddenly suspended her work&mdash;stayed
the tree as it bent to the breeze, stopped the bird in
the act of flight, fixed the water, and fastened the
shadows to the ground. What is there then to compensate
the artist for this limitation? Why, surely
he can represent nature as she is at a particular
moment, over the hills and valleys, or across great
plains, with sunlight and atmosphere to mark the
breadth and distance and so produce an illusion of
movement to delight the eyes of the observer with
bewitching surprise. For the eye as it involuntarily
travels from the foreground of the picture to the
background, proceeds from sign to sign, each decreasing
in definition in conformity with the changes
in nature, till vague suggestions of form announce
that far distance has been reached. The effect is
precisely that of the cinematograph, except that the
eye moves instead of the picture. The apparent
movement corresponds closely with the opening of
distance in nature when one proceeds in a fast moving
vehicle along a road from which a considerable
stretch of country may be observed. Very rarely is
the illusion so marked that the apparent movement
is identified to the senses. When it is so marked the
distance seems to come forward, but is instantaneously
stayed before consideration can be brought to
bear upon it. Clearly if one specially seek the illusion,
it becomes impossible because search implies
reason and an examination slow out of all proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
with the rapidity of the sensorial effect. Accident
alone will bring about the illusion, for it can
only arise when the eye travels at a certain rate over
the picture, the minimum of which rate is indeterminable.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>(See <a href="#Page_xii">page xii</a>)</p>
</div>


<p>It is evident that any landscape of fair size in
which considerable depth is indicated must necessarily
produce an illusion of opening distance if the
varying signs are sufficiently numerous and properly
painted in accordance with the aerial perspective;
and this illusion is undoubtedly the key to the
extraordinary beauty observed in the works of the
great masters of landscape since Claude unveiled
the secrets of distance painting. That the apparent
movement is rarely actually defined is immaterial,
for it must be there and must act upon the eye, producing
an involuntary sensation which we interpret
as pleasure arising from admiration of the skill of
the artist in giving us so good a representation of
distance in his imitation.</p>

<p>As will presently be seen there are other kinds of
illusion of motion which may be produced in landscape,
but this illusion of opening distance is the most
important, and it should be produced wherever
distance is represented. In nature the effect of the
unfolding of distance is caused by a sequence of
signs apparently diminishing in size and clearness as
the eye travels back, and a sequence of this kind
should be produced by the artist in his picture. It
is not sufficient that patches of colour of the tone
and shape of sections of vegetation, trees, varied soils,
and so on, be given, for while these may indicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>distance as any perspective must do, yet an illusion
cannot be produced by such signs because they are
not sufficiently numerous for the eye to experience a
cinematographic effect when passing over them. It
is not distance that gives the beauty, but an illusion
of opening distance, without which, and presuming
the absence of any other illusion, only simple harmonies
of tone and inanimate forms are possible.
Moreover the patches of colour do not properly represent
nature either as she appears to the eye, or as she
is understood from experience. If one were to take
a momentary glance at a view specially to receive the
general colour impression, he might conceivably retain
on his mind a collection of colour masses such
as is often put forward as a landscape, but natural
scenes are not observed in this way, and the artist
has no right to imply that a view should be painted
as it is observed at an instantaneous glance. One
cannot be supposed to keep his eyes closed, except for
a moment, when in front of nature, and he cannot be
in front of nature for more than a moment without
involuntarily recognizing thousands of signs. There
must necessarily be a certain clearness of the atmosphere
for distance to be represented, and in the
minimum clearness, trees, bushes, rivulets, and buildings
of every kind, are well defined at least to the
middle distance. These can and should be painted,
and there can be no object whatever in omitting
them, except the ignominious end of saving trouble.</p>

<p>And it is necessary that the signs, whether shadow
or substance, should be completely painted as they
appear to the eye in nature when observed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
average care by one inspecting a view for the purpose
of drinking in all its beauties, for this is how a painted
landscape is usually examined. There is no place in
the painter's art for a suggestive sign in the sense
that it may suggest a required complete sign. A sign
must be painted as completely as possible in conformity
with its appearance as seen from the presumed
point from which the artist sketched his view,
for the reason that its value as a sign depends upon
the readiness with which it is understood.<a name="Eanchor_63" id="Eanchor_63"></a><a href="#Enote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> This is
incontrovertible, otherwise the art of painting would
be an art of hieroglyphics. In poetry suggestion is
of great importance, and it may be so glowing as to
present to the imagination a higher form of beauty
than can be painted; but the signs of the painter
cannot suggest beauty in this way, because the exercise
of the imagination in respect of them is limited
by their form. A sign painted less distinctly than
as it is seen in nature is obviously removed from its
proper relative position, or else is untrue, and in
either case it must have a weakening effect upon the
picture.</p>

<p>The successful representation of aerial perspective
depends upon the careful and close gradation of tones
in conformity with the varying atmospheric density.
This is difficult work because of the disabilities arising
from the reduction of the scene into miniature
form, which necessitates the omission of many tones
and effects found in nature, just as a portrait in
miniature involves the exclusion of various elements
of expression in the human countenance. But
fortunately in landscape the variableness of nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
greatly assists the artist. Only rarely is the atmosphere
of equal density over a considerable depth
of ground, and this fact enables the painter to simplify
his work in production of the illusion without
appearing to depart from nature. Thus he may
deepen or contract his foreground within wide limits.
The changes in the appearance of the atmosphere in
nature have to be greatly concentrated in a painting,
and as this concentration becomes more difficult as
distance is reached, it follows that the artist has a
better chance of success by making the foreground
of his picture begin some way in front of him, rather
than near the spot where he is presumed to stand
when he executes his work. He may of course
maintain some very near ground while materially
shortening his middle distance, but this method must
obviously lower the beauty of the painting as a distance
landscape, and make the execution vastly more
difficult. Claude adopted this plan sometimes, but it
is seen in very few of his important works. In his
best time Turner was careful to set back his foreground,
and to refrain from restricting his middle
ground.</p>

<p>If a scene be taken from the middle distance only,
as in many Barbizon works, the labour is much simplified
because neither the close delineation of foliage,
nor any considerable gradation of atmosphere is required,
but then the beauty resulting from either of
these two exercises is missing. It is equally impossible
for such a scene to indicate growth and life,
or the charm of a changing view. Some modern
artists have a habit of blotting out the middle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
far distance by the introduction of a thick atmosphere
but this is an abuse of the art, because however true
the aspect may be in the sense that a natural view
is sometimes obscured by the atmosphere, the beauty
of the scene as a whole is hidden, and the picture
consists largely of an imitation of the mist, where an
illusion of movement is impossible. The painter
should imitate the more beautiful, and not the less
beautiful aspects of nature. Jupiter has been sometimes
painted as an incident in a picture, nearly
wholly concealed by a cloud, but to exhibit a separate
work of the god so concealed, would only be regarded
as an excuse for avoiding exertion, however well the
cloud may be painted; yet this would not be more
reprehensible than to hide the greater part of a view
by a dense atmosphere.</p>

<p>With a clear atmosphere an illusion of opening
distance may be secured with the far distance and the
greater part of the middle distance unobservable, but
in such a case a successful design is difficult to accomplish
owing to the limited number of signs available.
Many signs, as trees and houses, either darken
or hide the view, while sunlight effects on unobstructed
ground, sufficiently definite to be used as
signs, could not be very numerous without appearing
abnormal. The only really first-class method of
producing a satisfactory near-ground illusion was
invented by Hobbema in the later years of his life.
This is to use skilfully placed trees and other signs
through which paths wind, or appear to wind, and
to throw in a strong sunlight from the back.<a name="FNanchor_A_184" id="FNanchor_A_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_184" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>light enables far more signs to be used in depth
than would otherwise be possible, and so the eye has
a comparatively long track to follow. That the remarkable
beauty of the pictures of Hobbema composed
in this way is almost entirely due to the illusion
thus created, is readily seen when they are compared
with some of his other works, very similar in
all respects except that the light is thrown in from
the front or the side. Before placing his light at the
back, the artist tried the side plan in many pictures,
and while this was a decided improvement upon his
earlier efforts to secure depth of near-ground signs,
it was naturally inferior to the latest scheme. Jacob
Ruysdael adopted the plan of Hobbema in two or
three works with great effect.<a name="FNanchor_B_185" id="FNanchor_B_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_185" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>


<p>When the middle distance is hidden by a rising
foreground, an illusion may be created by the far
distance alone if this be of considerable depth. Since
the fifteenth century it has been a frequent practice
to conceal the middle distance, though mostly in
pictures of figure subjects.<a name="Eanchor_64" id="Eanchor_64"></a><a href="#Enote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The Dutch artists of
the seventeenth century who painted open-air scenes
of human and animal life, as Paul Potter, Wouverman,
and Albert Cuyp, avoided the middle distance
whenever possible, but often managed to secure a
fair illusion. In pure landscape the system is less
often practised, and never by great artists.</p>

<p>The only means available to the painter of land
views for creating an illusion of motion, apart from
that of opening distance, is by the representation of
flowing water so that a series of successive events in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>the flow, each connected with, but varying in character
from, the preceding one, can be exhibited.
Thus, a volume of water from a fall proceeds rapidly
over a flat surface to a ledge, and thence perhaps to
another ledge of a different depth, from which it
passes over or round irregular rocks and boulders,
and thence over smaller stones or into a stream,
creating in its passage every kind of eddy and
current.<a name="FNanchor_A_186" id="FNanchor_A_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_186" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Here is a series of progressive natural
actions in which the progression is regular and
continuous, while the separate actions cover such
time and space that they may be readily separated
by the eye. If, therefore, the whole series be properly
represented, an illusion of motion will result.<a name="Eanchor_65" id="Eanchor_65"></a><a href="#Enote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
Obviously the canvas must be of considerable size,
and the breaks in the flow of water as varied in
character and as numerous as possible. Everdingen
and Jacob Ruysdael seem to have been the first
artists to recognize the significance of this progression,
but Ruysdael far surpassed his master in the exhibition
of it. He examined the problem in all its variations,
solved it in a hundred ways, and at his death
left little for succeeding painters to learn regarding
it. Very rarely, one meets with a landscape where
the double illusion of motion of water and opening
distance is provided, and needless to say the effect
is superb.<a name="FNanchor_B_187" id="FNanchor_B_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_187" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>Sea views occupy a position by themselves inasmuch
as there is a fixed horizontal distance for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>artist. He cannot shorten this depth without making
his work look abnormal, and an effort to increase
it by presuming that the picture is painted from a
considerable height above the sea level, is seldom
successful because the observer of the work finds a
difficulty in fitting in the novelty with his experience.
Except when depicting stormy weather, or showing a
thick atmosphere, the painter of a sea view has no
trouble in obtaining absolute accuracy in his linear
perspective, but this is not sufficient, for if a variety
of trees, herbage, brooks, and so on, requires an illusion
of movement, then certainly does a sea view
which has monotony for its keynote. The motion of
the waves in fine weather cannot be suggested on canvas
because it is continuous and equal. One wave
displaces another and so far as the eye can reach there
is only a succession of similar waves. Thus the
motion appears unbroken, and from the canvas point
of view the waves must be motionless as the sand
hillocks of a desert. Of course in the actual view,
the expanse, the "immeasurable stretch of ocean," is
impressive and to some extent weird, but nothing of
this feeling is induced by a painted miniature. With
a bright sky and clear atmosphere the painter of a
sea view cannot well obtain an illusion of opening
distance by means of a multiplication of signs as on
land, for the introduction of many vessels would give
the work a formal appearance, but the problem can
be satisfactorily solved by putting the sun in the sky
towards the setting, and using cloud shadows as
signs. Aivasovsky, one of the greatest marine
painters of modern times, was very successful with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
this class of work. His long shadows thrown at
right angles to the line of sight, carry back the distance
till the horizon seems to be further off than
experience warrants, the illusion being perfect. An
illusion of opening distance may, however, be easily
obtained in a sea view when there is a haze covering,
but not hiding, the horizon, by introducing as signs,
two or three vessels, the first in the middle distance.</p>

<p>Another method of giving a suggestion of motion,
which may be used by the sea painter, is in truthfully
representing the appearance of the water round
a vessel passing through it. What is probably the
finest example of this work in existence is Jacob
Ruysdael's The Rising Storm.<a name="FNanchor_A_188" id="FNanchor_A_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_188" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> The sea is shown
close to a port, and half a dozen smacks and small
boats are being tossed about by choppy, breaking
waves. In the centre of the picture is a large smack
over the weather bow of which a huge foaming wave
has broken, and part is spending its force on the lee
bow, from which the water gradually becomes quieter
till at the stern of the boat little more than a black
concavity is seen. The progression of wave movement
is completely represented, and the effect is very
impressive.</p>

<p>The coast painter can produce an excellent illusion
of motion from waves breaking on a beach, for in
nature this action is made up of a series of different
consecutive acts each of which is easily distinguishable
to the eye. The wave rises, bends over its top
which becomes crested, and splashes forward on the
beach, to be converted into foam which races
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>onwards, breaking up as it goes till it reaches the watermark,
then rapidly falling back to be met by another
wave. Here is a series of consecutive incidents
which can all be painted so as to deceive for a moment
with the idea of motion. The attempt to
represent the action of waves breaking against steep
rocks is invariably a failure, because of the great
reduction of the apparent number of incidents forming
the consecutive series. In nature the eye is not
quick enough to follow the separate events, and so
they cannot be distinguished in a painting. Thomson's
fine picture of Fast Castle is distinctly marred
by a wide irregular column of water shown splashing
up against a rock. There is no possibility here of
representing a series of actions, and so an instant
suffices to fix the water on the rock. In another
work by the same artist there are waves breaking
against precipitous rocks, but in this case the water
first passes over an expanse of low lying rocks, and a
sequence of actions is shown right up to the cliff,
an excellent illusion of movement being brought
about.<a name="FNanchor_A_189" id="FNanchor_A_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_189" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<p>Apart from those exhibiting an illusion of motion of
some kind, the only landscapes which have a permanent
value, are near-ground scenes in which conditions
of atmosphere of common experience, as rain or storm
are faithfully rendered. In these works the signs
must be numerous and varied in character, for it is
only in the multiplication of small changes of form
and tone that the natural effects of a particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>weather condition can be imitated. Jacob Ruysdael
and Constable were the greatest masters of this form
of landscape, Crome and Boecklin closely approaching
them, but it is uncommon for a serious worker in
landscape to attempt a picture where distance is not
recorded. The best paintings of Constable present
an illusion of opening distance, and when Jacob Ruysdael
painted near-ground only, it was nearly always
a hilly slope with water breaking over low rocks.</p>

<p>Moonlight and twilight scenes are not good subjects
for the painter of landscape, because, shown as
they must be in daylight, or with artificial light,
they become distinctly uninteresting after the first
impression of tonal harmony has passed away, owing
to the unconscious revolt of the mind against something
with an unreal appearance.<a name="Eanchor_66" id="Eanchor_66"></a><a href="#Enote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> This is the chief
reason why no scene has lived which depended for its
beauty entirely upon moonlight effects. It is about
two hundred and fifty years since Van der Neer
died, and he still remains practically the only
moonlight painter known to us whose works seem of
permanent interest. But he did not rely altogether
upon moonlight effects for his beauty, for the representation
of distance is the principal feature in all his
works. Further he commonly makes us acquainted
with the human life and habitations of his time, and
in this way enhances our appreciation of his pictures.
Before Van der Neer, moonlight scenes were very
rarely executed, and only two or three of these have
remained which are worthy of serious consideration.
The best of them is a view by Rubens, where the light
is comparatively strong, and practically the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of the beauty rests in the opening distance, which can
hardly be surpassed in a work of this kind.<a name="FNanchor_A_190" id="FNanchor_A_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_190" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to deal with varieties of pure
landscape other than those mentioned. They are
painted in their myriads, and form pleasant tonal
harmonies, or have local interest, but they do not
live. As the foliage in springtime they are fresh and
welcome to the eye when they first appear, but all too
soon they fade and disappear from memory like the
leaves of the autumn.</p>

<p>In landscape as in all other branches of painting,
whatever is ephemeral in nature, or of uncommon experience,
should be avoided. Rare sun effects and
exceptional phases of atmosphere should not find
their way into pictures, while strokes of lightning
and rainbows should only be present when they are
necessitated by the design, and then must be subordinated
as far as possible. Of all these things the
most strongly to be deprecated are strange sunlight
effects, for they have the double drawback for the
painter, of rarity and evanescence in nature. A
stroke of lightning is not out of place where the conditions
may be presumed to be more or less permanent,
as in the celebrated picture of Apelles, where
Alexander was represented in the character of Jupiter
casting a thunderbolt, and forks of lightning proceed
from his hand; or where the occurrence is essential
in the composition, as in Gilbert's Slaying of Job's
Sheep.<a name="FNanchor_A_191" id="FNanchor_A_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_191" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> So in Danby's The Sixth Seal Opened, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>lightning is quite appropriate, for all nature is disturbed.
In Martin's Plague of Hail, and The Destruction
of Pharaoh, the first a night scene, and the
second a view darkened by dense black clouds, lightning
is well used for lighting purposes; and in Cot's
The Storm,<a name="FNanchor_B_192" id="FNanchor_B_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_192" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> where the background is dark and no sky
is visible, lightning is the only means possessed by
the artist of explaining that the fear expressed by the
lovers in the foreground, arises from the approaching
storm. Great masters like Giorgione,<a name="FNanchor_C_193" id="FNanchor_C_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_193" class="fnanchor">[j]</a>
Rubens,<a name="FNanchor_D_194" id="FNanchor_D_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_194" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Poussin,<a name="FNanchor_E_195" id="FNanchor_E_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_195" class="fnanchor">[l]</a> used a stroke of lightning on rare occasions,
but took every care that it should not be conspicuous,
or interfere in any way with the first view of the
picture. The lightning is invariably placed in the
far background, and no light is apparently reflected
from it.</p>

<p>A rainbow in nature has a life of appreciable duration,
and so may be appropriately used in landscape,
but obviously it should be regarded as a minor
accessory except where it forms a necessary feature
in the design.<a name="FNanchor_A_196" id="FNanchor_A_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_196" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> The great drawback in a prominent
rainbow is that it forces itself upon the attention
of the observer to the detriment of the picture as a
whole, and if it be very conspicuous and crosses the
middle of the painted view, as in Turner's Arundel
Castle, the picture appears divided in two parts, and
the possibility of an illusion of opening distance is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_B_197" id="FNanchor_B_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_197" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> Almost as bad is the effect when a rainbow
cuts off a corner of a picture, for this suggests at
first sight an accidental interference with the work.<a name="FNanchor_C_198" id="FNanchor_C_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_198" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Of all artists Rubens seemed to know best how to use
a rainbow. He adopts three methods. The first
and best is to put the bow entirely in the sky<a name="FNanchor_D_199" id="FNanchor_D_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_199" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>; the
second to throw it right into the background where
part of it is dissolved in the view<a name="FNanchor_E_200" id="FNanchor_E_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_200" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>; and the third to
indicate the bow in one part of the picture, and overshadow
it with a strong sunlight thrown in from
another part.<a name="FNanchor_F_201" id="FNanchor_F_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_201" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> Any of these forms seems to answer
well, but they practically exhaust the possibilities
in general design. A section of a rainbow may be
shown with one end of it on the ground, because this
is observable in nature<a name="FNanchor_G_202" id="FNanchor_G_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_202" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>; but to cut off the top of the
arch as if there were no room for it on the canvas
is obviously bad, for the two segments left appear
quite unnatural.<a name="FNanchor_H_203" id="FNanchor_H_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_203" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>The small rainbows sometimes seen at waterfalls
are occasionally introduced into paintings, but rarely
with success because they tend to interfere with the
general view of the scene. Such views are necessarily
near ground, and so a bow must seriously injure the
picture unless it be placed at the side, as in Innes's
fine work of Niagara Falls (the example of 1884).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>The use of a rainbow as a track in classical pictures
is sometimes effective, though the landscape
is largely sacrificed owing to the compulsory great
width and bright appearance of the bow, which must
indeed practically absorb the attention of the observer.
The best known picture of this kind is
Schwind's Rainbow, which shows the beautiful form
of Iris wrapped in the sheen of the bow, and descending
with great speed, the idea being apparently taken
from Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_A_204" id="FNanchor_A_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_204" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> To use the top of the rainbow for a
walking track is bad, as the mind instinctively repels
the invention as opposed to reason.<a name="FNanchor_B_205" id="FNanchor_B_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_205" class="fnanchor">[v]</a></p>

<p>But if fleeting natural phenomena become disturbing
to the observer of a picture, how much more
objectionable are the quickly disappearing effects of
artificial devices, as the lights from explosions. In a
battle scene covering a wide area of ground, a small
cloud of smoke here and there is not out of place,
because under natural conditions such a cloud lasts
for an appreciable time; but no good artist will indicate
in his work a flash from a gun, for this would
immediately become stagy and unreal to the observer.
Nor can fireworks of the ordinary kind be
properly represented in a picture. The beauty of
these fireworks lies in the appearance out of nothing,
as it were, of brilliant showers of coloured lights, and
their rapid disappearance, to be replaced by others
of different form and character, the movement and
changes constituting important elements in their
appreciation. But the painter can only indicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>them by fixed points of light which necessarily
appear abnormal. Stationary points of light can
have no resemblance whatever to fireworks, and if
the title of the picture forces the imagination to see
in them expiring sparks from a rocket, the impression
can only last a moment, and will be succeeded by a
revolt in the mind against so glaring an impossibility
as a number of permanent sparks. The only
painted firework display that does not appear abnormal
is a fountain of fire and sparks which may be
presumed to last for some time, and therefore would
not quickly tire the mind.<a name="FNanchor_A_206" id="FNanchor_A_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_206" class="fnanchor">[w]</a></p>

<h3>STILL-LIFE</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Its comparative difficulty&mdash;Its varieties&mdash;Its limitations.</p>


<p>Right through the degrees of the art of the painter
till we reach still-life, the difficulty in producing the
art is in proportion to the general beauty therein,
but in the case of still-life the object is much less
readily gained than in simple landscape which is on
a higher level in painting. The causes of this apparent
anomaly appear to be as follows:&mdash;Firstly in
miniature painting one does not expect such close
resemblance to nature as in still-life which usually
represents things in their natural size: secondly, in
still-life the relative position of the parts can never be
such as to appear novel, whereas in landscape their
position is always more or less unexpected: thirdly,
in still-life the colours are practically fixed, for the
painter cannot depart from the limited variety of
tints commonly connected with the objects indicated,
while in landscape the colouring may vary almost
indefinitely from sun effects without appearing to
depart from nature.</p>

<p>The beauty in still-life paintings may arise from
several causes, namely, the pleasure experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
from the excellence of the imitation; the harmony of
tones; the beauty of the things imitated; the association
of ideas; and the pleasure derived from the acquisition
of knowledge. Aristotle seemed to think
this last one of the principal reasons for our appreciation
of the painter's work, though he agreed that the
better the imitation, the greater the pleasure to the
observer. The argument appears to apply particularly
to the lower forms of life because in nature they
are not often closely examined. A cauliflower for
instance may be seen a thousand times by one who
would not carefully note its structure, but if he see
an imitation of it painted by a good artist, his astonishment
at the excellence of the imitation might
cause him to observe the representation closely, and
learn much about the vegetable which he did not
know before. In this way the information gained
would add to his pleasure.</p>

<p>As in landscape, from the absence of abstract
qualities from the things represented, and since the
position of the signs may be indefinitely varied without
a sense of incongruity resulting, there can be
no ideal in still-life, and so the painter cannot pass
beyond experience without achieving the abnormal.</p>

<p>The painter of still-life has the choice of four kinds
of imitation, namely, the representation of products
of nature which are in themselves beautiful, as roses
and fine plumaged birds; the imitation of products of
human industry which are in themselves beautiful,
as sculptured plate or fine porcelain; the representation
of natural and manual products which in themselves
are neither beautiful nor displeasing, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
interest from association of ideas, as certain fruits,
books, and musical instruments; and the imitation
of things which in themselves are not pleasing to the
sight, as dead game, kitchen utensils, and so on.
Obviously the artist may assort any two or more of
these varieties in the same picture. He may also
associate them with life, but here he is met with a
grave difficulty which goes to the very root of art.
If two forms, not being merely accessories, are
associated together in a design, the lower form
must necessarily be subordinated, otherwise the
mind of the observer will be disturbed by the apparent
double objective. A live dog or other animal
in a still-life composition will immediately attract
the eye of the observer, drawing off his attention from
the inanimate objects represented, which will consequently
thereafter lose much of their interest. The
presence of a man is still worse. Not only is it
natural and inevitable that a human being should
take precedence of whatever is inanimate in a work
of art, but in the case of still-life, where he is painted
of natural size, he must necessarily overshadow
everything else in the picture. Further, his own
representation is much injured because the surroundings
exercise a disconcerting influence. Even with
the human figures of such a work executed by a
painter of the first rank, they are quite uninteresting.<a name="FNanchor_A_207" id="FNanchor_A_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_207" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>Beautiful products of nature such as brilliant
flowers and butterflies, cannot be imitated so well
that the representations appear as beautiful as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>things themselves, and so are unsuited as entire
subjects for paintings, for we are usually well acquainted
with these things, and consciously or unconsciously
recognize the inferiority of the imitation.
The greatest flower painters have therefore wisely
refrained from introducing into their works more than
a few fine roses or similar blooms. The presence of
many less beautiful flowers in which the imitation is,
or appears to be, more pleasing than the natural
forms, neutralizes or overcomes the effect of the
inferior imitation of the more beautiful. In fact
the extent to which natural products which are
necessarily more beautiful than the imitations, may
be used in painting, except as incidentals, is very
limited. They cannot appropriately be used at all
on walls and curtains where they continually cross
the vision, for they would there quickly tire owing
to the involuntary dissatisfaction with the representation.
The Japanese, whose whole art of painting
was for centuries concentrated upon light internal
decoration, rightly discard from this form of art
all natural products which are necessarily superior to
the imitations, and confine their attention to those
signs which, while being actually more beautiful,
when closely seen, than the imitations, do not appear
to be so in nature where they are usually observed
at some distance from the eye. Thus, waterfowl of
various kinds, small birds of the hedges, storks,
herons, branches of fruit blossoms, light trees and
vegetation, are infinitely preferable to the more
beautiful products for purely decorative purposes.
A common pigeon with an added bright feather, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
better on a wall or screen than the most brilliant
pheasant, for in the one case the representation
appears above ordinary experience, and in the other
case, below it.</p>

<p>The decorative artist then is at liberty to enhance
the beauty of his signs, but not to take for them
things which are commonly observed in nature, and
whose beauty he cannot equal. But there should be
no wide divergence between the natural beauty and
the art, and nothing which in itself is unpleasing is
suitable for decoration. It may be introduced in a
hanging picture, because here a sense of beauty may
be derived from the excellence of the imitation, as in
the case of a dead hare or a basket of vegetables; but
in pure decoration the effect is general and not particular,
and so the imitation yields no beauty apart
from that of the thing imitated.</p>

<h3>SECONDARY ART</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Paintings of record&mdash;Scenes from the novel and written drama&mdash;From
the acted drama&mdash;Humorous subjects&mdash;Allegorical works.</p>


<p>When the invention of the painter is circumscribed
by the requirements of another art, whether a fine
art or not, then his art ceases to be a pure art and
becomes an art of record, subordinate to the art by
which his work is circumscribed. This may be
termed the Secondary Art of painting. The art
may be of importance outside the purposes of the
fine arts, and in certain cases may be productive of
good pictures, but only by way of accident: hence a
work of secondary art never engages the attention of
a great artist unless he be specially called upon to
execute it. Hard and fast lines dividing the pure
from the secondary art cannot be laid down, as one
often verges on the other, but there is a general distinction
between them which is easily comprehensible
in the separate branches of
painting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Secondary art is not produced from incidents or
characters taken from sacred or mythological history,
because here the general invention of the painter is
never circumscribed, for he is able to produce form
and expression above experience. In profane history
the art is secondary when the painter confines his
invention to recorded details. Thus in a picture of
the Coronation of Charlemagne, the composition is
entirely invented by the artist, and so the work
becomes one of pure art; but the representation of
the Coronation of Queen Victoria, where the artist
reproduces the scene as it actually occurred, is
secondary art, for he is precluded from the exercise
of his imagination in the design, the end of art being
subordinated to that of record or history. Such a
picture is necessarily stiff and formal. Where the
scene represents a number of actions, as in a battle
design, the artist is unable to record the actual occurrence,
though he may represent particular actions;
consequently he has large scope for his imagination,
and may limit his representation to those actions
which together make a fine example of pure art.
But a battle scene where a particular event, as a
meeting of generals, has to be painted, immediately
becomes secondary art, for then the surrounding
battle events would be accessory in their nature. It
is possible for simple historical works painted to order
centuries ago to appear now as of high art value,
because we commonly connect a strict formality
with old pictures of the kind, whether executed from
records or invention. Thus Holbein's Henry VIII.
presenting a Charter to the Barber-Surgeons no doubt
closely depicts the actual event, yet the stiffness of
the design does not seem out of place.<a name="FNanchor_A_208" id="FNanchor_A_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_208" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Nevertheless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>it is a refreshing change from this picture to Richard
III. offered the Crown by London Merchants, which
is a magnificent modern work of pure invention.<a name="FNanchor_B_209" id="FNanchor_B_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_209" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>A scene from a story of actual life is necessarily
secondary art, because here the painter imitates what
is already an imitation, and cannot ascend above
experience. He is confined to the invention of the
novelist, and is therefore subordinate to him.</p>

<p>The written drama is available for the painter as a
source for designs only in cases of high tragedy, or
mixed plays containing strong dramatic events of
tragic import. Seeing that the drama is itself an
imitative art, only such actions or characters can be
used by the painter which are above life experience,
and it is only in tragedy that the dramatist can exalt
human attributes, and ennoble the passions above
this experience. Tragedy deals directly with the
two great contrasting human mysteries&mdash;life and
death. From one to the other is the most awful
and sublime action within human knowledge, and
consequently the motives and sentiments relating to
it may be carried to the loftiest reach of the understanding.
An exaggeration of ordinary life, where
the combination of perfected parts in form and expression
is not possible, means only the abnormal;
while comedy, which imitates conditions inferior to
ordinary life, cannot be exaggerated except into distortion.
High tragedy therefore is the only section
of the written drama that concerns the painter. If
he draw from any other work of the dramatist he
only produces secondary art, as when he draws from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>the novelist. The picture may be interesting, but
both interest and beauty will be fleeting.</p>

<p>While the painter may use the written drama in
certain cases, he can by no means be concerned with
the acted drama. It is useless to attempt to produce
a good picture by imitating an imitation accomplished
by a combined art, as the opera or drama.
A painted scene from a play as it is acted, is merely
the execution of another man's design which in itself
is entirely circumscribed by conditions of action
and speech wholly foreign to the art of the painter.
A picture of a particular moment of action in a
written play, as it is thrown upon the brain in the
course of reading, is interesting, firstly because our
imagination has wide limits of invention, and we
naturally and instinctively adopt a harmonious
rendering of the scene so far as the writing will
allow; and secondly for the reason that we pass
rapidly from impression to impression, and so the
whole significance of each picture, separately and
relatively, is conveyed to us. But a painting of an
acted scene is meaningless, for it can represent only
one in a series of a thousand moments of action which
are all connected, and of which the comprehension
of any one is dependent upon our knowledge of
the whole. The painter has no scope. He simply
copies a number of figures in a fixed setting, and the
result is necessarily inferior art to a copy of the poorest
original picture, since in this case the artist at
least copies the direct product of the imagination,
while in the other he has only before him a series of
dummies who are imitating the product. The sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of unreality arising from such a picture must instantly
overpower any harmony of colour or form
that may be present.</p>

<p>Where the portrait of an actor is painted in a stage
r&ocirc;le, the same principle is involved, though the result
is not so disastrous. We still have the unreal, but
it is painted and put forward as a living person.
The artist moreover has a little imaginative scope.
He can choose a moment of action best suited to his
art, and may even vary the character of the action,
which is not possible where an acted scene is depicted.
But notwithstanding all the relative advantages, a
Raphael could not make a fine picture out of a man
in character. He may largely overcome the disabilities
arising from the limitation to his invention;
he may introduce great effects of light and shade;
may ennoble expression and give grandeur to form;
but he will never hide the sham&mdash;never conceal the
fact that he is representing an imitation of life. The
actor on the stage is one of a number of signs used
by the dramatist. His identity apart from the sign
is lost, or presumed to be lost for the time being, and
so he is not a sham; but outside of the stage his use
or meaning as a sign does not exist. Hence the
representation of this sign as a subject of a painting
is only a degree less incongruous than would be the
introduction of a painted figure as one of the characters
of a stage scene.</p>

<p>It is an indication of the sure public instinct in
matters of art principles, that general opinion has
always tacitly condemned paintings of stage scenes
and characters. They have not infrequently been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
produced, and sometimes artists of high rank, as
Reynolds and Lawrence, have painted portraits of
actors in stage r&ocirc;les, but never has one met with
public appreciation as a work of art. Probably in
most cases these works were executed as mementoes
rather than as works of art, for it is scarcely possible
to conceive a painter of the stamp of Reynolds, who
was so well acquainted with first principles, putting
forward even a portrait of Garrick in a stage r&ocirc;le, as
a serious work, notwithstanding that he might well
know that it was a masterpiece in respect of execution.</p>

<p>Humour is not a subject for the painter to deal with,
for a humorous picture cannot be comprehended
without the assistance of another art. Further,
comedy is founded upon a sense of the ridiculous,
which means distortion of form or idea. Distortion
of form would tend to destroy the art if reproduced,
and distortion of idea implies events in time which
are beyond the scope of the painter. If any humour
were exhibited in the representation of a single
moment of action in a story, it would quickly disappear,
for a permanent joke is beyond the range of
human understanding. In poetry and fiction, humour
may be appropriately introduced, because here
it is of a fugitive character, and may serve as a
possible relief of the mind, as a discordant note in
music; but in a painting, the moment of humour is
fixed, and a fixed laugh suggests mental disorder.</p>

<p>Nor is there place in the art of the painter for
works intending to convey satire or irony, for such
pictures also mean distortion. Moreover they are
merely substitutes for, or adjuncts to, the art of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
writing. The object of caricature is to present an
idea in a more direct and rapid way than it can be
expressed in writing, and not specially to exhibit
beauty, which is the purpose of the painter. Hogarth's
many caricatures are composed of superlative
signs of writing, and not of any fine art. Cartoons
(as the word is commonly understood) are of the
nature of allegory, and may afford scope for the
painter, but as they necessarily refer to more or less
fleeting conditions of a political or social character,
they cannot retain permanent interest.</p>

<p>Allegorical paintings are secondary art when they
endeavour to cover more than a moment of time
in a single design, or when the allegory is merely
a metaphor applying to action. The first variety is
rarely seen in modern works, but it was not very
uncommon from the fifteenth to the seventeenth
century, though it was never produced by first-class
artists, and seldom indeed by those of the second
rank. Quite a number of works of this period, formerly
supposed to have an allegorical signification,
are now properly identified as rarely represented
mythological legends, or historical incidents which
have only lately been unearthed,<a name="FNanchor_A_210" id="FNanchor_A_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_210" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> and we may rest
assured from internal evidence that many others
of the same kind will yet be newly interpreted. A
good design cannot be produced from an event in
time because the figures in a presumed action must
be shown in repose,<a name="FNanchor_B_211" id="FNanchor_B_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_211" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> or else the action appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>incongruous and opposed to experience, as when a
goddess is overpowered by a personage with the appearance
of a human being.<a name="FNanchor_C_212" id="FNanchor_C_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_212" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> In both cases the
figures must seem to be falsities. Designs of the
first kind can only be properly represented in a sequence
of pictures, each indicating a particular
action, as in the Marie de' Medici series of Rubens;
and those of the second by commonly accepted
figures of sacred or mythological history or legend,
as where St. Michael and the Dragon typify Good
overcoming Evil.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to do more than barely
refer to the use of metaphor by the painter when the
representation of action is involved, as for instance
if he should produce a picture of a heaving ship in a
storm, to meet the metaphor "As a ship is tossed on a
rough sea, so has been the course of my life," though
this kind of picture has been occasionally executed,
the artist forgetting that it is not the object depicted
that is compared, but the action&mdash;in the example
quoted, the tossing of the ship&mdash;which cannot be
represented on canvas. Another form of metaphor
sometimes used by the painter is that where a comparison
of ideas is represented by physical proportions,
as in Wiertz's Things of the Present as seen by
the Future, in which the things of the present are
indicated by liliputian figures on the hand of a woman
of life size who represents the future. Needless to
say that such designs, of which there are about a
dozen in existence, can only suggest distortion, for
the smaller figures must appear too small, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>larger ones too great; or if our experience with
miniature imitations of the human figure warrants
us in regarding the smaller figures as reasonable, then
the larger ones must appear as giants of the Brobdingnagian
order.</p>

<p>The only form of metaphor which may be used by
the painter is that wherein a beautiful symbol typifies
a high abstract quality. Metaphor belongs
properly to the arts of the poet and novelist who can
indicate the symbol and things symbolized in immediate
succession, so that the whole meaning is
apparent. The painter can only represent the symbol,
and unless this is beautiful and its purport
readily comprehended, his sign is merely a hieroglyph&mdash;a
sign of writing. Secondary art includes symbolic
painting when the symbol may represent either
the symbol itself or the thing symbolized, for such a
condition involves a confusion of ideas which tends
to destroy the &aelig;sthetic effect of the work. The most
notable painting of this kind is Holman Hunt's
The Scapegoat, where the design shows only a goat
in desert country. The scapegoat has ceased to be an
actuality for centuries, and the only meaning of the
term as it is now used applies to a man: hence, with
the title the goat appears to be a symbol of both a man
and an animal, while without the title it is merely the
image of a goat without symbolism. But the conception
of an animal of any kind as a symbol is
foreign to the art of the painter whose symbol should
always be beautiful, whatever the nature of the
representation.</p>

<h3>COLOUR</h3>


<p>In itself colour has no virtues which are not
governed by immutable laws. These are apart
from the exercise of human faculties, the recognition
of colour harmony being involuntary and entirely
dependent upon the condition of the optic nerves.
Thus there can be no meaning in colour apart from
its application to form, and the extent to which it
may be properly used in the representation of form
is necessarily bound by our experience of nature.
Other things being equal, the most perfect painting
is that wherein there is a just balance between the
colour and the form, that is to say, where the colour
is not so vivid as to act upon the sense nerves before
the general beauty of the work is appreciated, or so
feeble or discordant that its want of natural truth
is immediately presented to the mind, thus disturbing
the impression of the design.</p>

<p>As with metrical form in poetry, the importance
of colour in painting varies inversely with the character
of the art. In the highest art, where ideals
are dealt with, colour is of the least importance. A
composition with ideal figures may be produced by
drawing only, that is to say, by the use of a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
tone in outline and shading. The addition of colour
heightens the beauty of a composition of this kind,
not so much because of the new sensorial harmony
acquired, as for the reason that a painting in colours,
corresponding better than a colourless drawing with
our experience of nature, assists in defining the work
and so reduces the fractional time necessary for
the recognition of the general beauty of the design,
which is a matter of importance. The comparatively
small value of colour in the highest art is demonstrated
by experience. If we were to choose from
paintings known to us, those which general opinion
regards as the very greatest works, we should
unquestionably name the frescoes of Raphael and
Michelangelo at the Vatican, and those of Correggio
at Parma. These, with a few easel pictures
of Raphael, and perhaps a dozen other pictures
by various masters, are the only works of the
painter's art to which the term "sublime" may be
properly applied. As with the great epic poems,
they are concerned entirely with ideals&mdash;with personages
far above the level of life, rising to the
spiritual domain&mdash;or with human beings as they
would be if the highest conceptions of our imagination
were possible of realization. When we recall
these splendid legacies of genius to our minds, and
ponder over the apparently limitless range of human
vision which they evidence, it is the designs that
absorb us, and not the colour&mdash;the forms and expression,
and not the tints by which their definition
is assisted. We do not usually analyse the impression
we receive from these frescoes and pictures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
but were we to do so, it would be borne in upon our
minds that while a Raphael, a Michelangelo, or a
Correggio, would be required to conceive and execute
such stupendous designs, many thousands of unknown
patient workers could be found to colour
them efficiently. On the other hand if we remove
the colour from the greatest landscape known to us,
we find that most of the beauty of the work has
disappeared, and that we have only a kind of skeleton
left, for the beauty of such a picture rests very
largely upon the aerial perspective, which is unobtainable
without colour.</p>

<p>That the appreciation of colour is relative to the
character of the design may be observed from common
experience. We may see the Sistine Madonna
half a dozen times and then be unable to recall the
colours when bringing the picture to mind, so small
an effect have they had upon us as compared with
that of the majesty and general beauty of the central
figure. So with many of Raphael's other pictures.
It is a common thing for one to call attention to the
superb colouring of an easel picture by Correggio,
but how rarely does an observer notice the colouring
of his frescoes at Parma, which are his masterpieces?
With some of the Venetian artists, the colouring is
often so brilliant, not to say startling, that it seems
to overpower the observer for a moment, and necessity
compels him to accustom himself to the tones
before considering the design. The colouring of
Titian is not so strong, but it is always forcible;
nevertheless one seldom hears a comment upon the
colours in his works, the superior design and general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
beauty of the compositions far outweighing the purely
sensorial elements therein. Titian in fact secured
an approximately just balance between form and
colour, while with his great followers the colour
usually exceeded in strength the requirements of the
design. In the time of Tintoretto and Veronese
the prestige and prosperity of Venice were rapidly
declining, but we have been so accustomed to
associate with this city during the Renaissance, a
luxurious life with something of the character of an
Eastern court, that gorgeous colour of any kind does
not seem out of place as one of its products. But
this special appropriateness has not the effect of
elevating the gay coloured voluptuous forms of the
artists named, observable in their classical and allegorical
works, to a high level in art. We cannot accommodate
the forms to the ideas of the poets who
invented or described them, or to the attributes
with which they were commonly associated; and
the colouring tends to bring them closer to earth.
While we feel bound to admire the colouring, we
are equally compelled to regret the particular
application.<a name="Eanchor_67" id="Eanchor_67"></a><a href="#Enote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Speaking generally, when the design is good we
remember the composition irrespective of the colours,
but when the beauty of the work depends upon
the colour harmony it fades from our memory as
soon as our eyes experience new colour combinations.
The imagination may call up the harmony again
upon the mind, but the pleasure experienced from
this reflection must be very feeble indeed because
the senses are not directly affected thereby. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
can have no more effect than a written description
of the harmony.</p>

<p>The painter is at liberty to make what use he will
of colour so long as he provides a thing of beauty,
but he must remember that the appreciation of colour
harmony is dependent not only upon the condition
of the optic nerves of the observer, but also upon
his experience at the time of observation. As to the
first consideration little heed need be taken, because
rudimentarily the nerve structure is equal or nearly
so, in all persons, and while accident at birth may
provide in some an advanced condition which in
others is only obtained by exercise, yet in respect
of colours, experience in complex harmony is gained
involuntarily in contact with every-day nature.
Hence for the purpose of the painter, all men may
be considered alike in regard to the recognition of
colour harmony. But individual experience at the
time of observation of a painting varies largely,<a name="Eanchor_68" id="Eanchor_68"></a><a href="#Enote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
a circumstance which is not of importance in dealing
with works of the higher art, but becomes of great
significance when considering the lower forms. No
organ of the body is so susceptible to fatigue as the
eye, and a painting of the kind known as a colour
scheme may or may not be pleasing according as the
tone is a relief or otherwise to the sight. Sometimes
a few seconds are sufficient to fatigue the eye, as for
instance when it is directed towards a vivid maroon
hanging, but let a landscape with a grey tone be
placed on the hanging and considerable pleasure
will be involuntarily experienced through the relief
to the optic nerves. Remove the picture to a grey
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>wall, and it will instantly lose its charm, except such
as it may possess apart from the colour.</p>

<p>As with particular tones, so with colours generally.
People habituated to conditions of nature where
extremes of sun effects are uncommon, as in the
northern latitudes, may be temporarily pleased with
schemes of glowing colours on their walls, because
these relieve the monotony of daily experience, but
they must necessarily quickly tire, as with all exceptional
conditions of life which are concerned with
the senses only. How soon one is fatigued with
bright colours generally is obvious to any visitor to a
public gallery which is crowded with pictures. In
an hour or less the fatigue of his eyes becomes so
extreme that his whole nervous system is affected,
and he loses energy of both mind and body. But
brilliant colors used sparingly with good designs may
be a perpetual source of pleasure. Place a fine work
by Rubens or Paolo Veronese in a living-room and it
will attract attention every time one enters, for the
colouring will always be a change from the normal
eye experience. One turns to the picture involuntarily,
and then the design is observed, and so one
passes from sensual to intellectual pleasure. This
process is repeated day by day, and the work never
tires. Of course it is a condition that the design
is able to hold the attention, otherwise the bright
colours would serve little better purpose than if they
defined a geometrical pattern.</p>

<p>Nowadays quite a number of paintings are produced
in which unusual tones are given to signs or
shadows, but these are not to be taken seriously by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the earnest student. In the sunlight, amidst certain
surroundings, the arm of a woman may appear for
some moments to have a bluish tone, but the artist
would be entirely wrong to paint a bluish arm. The
picture is to be seen under all lights, and if the tones
be contrary to general experience under any of these
lights, then the work appears to be a falsity, for the
artist does not, and cannot, reproduce the conditions
which together bring about the exceptional colours.
To the normal eye under ordinary circumstances,
the arm of a woman is of flesh colour, and the artist
is not at liberty to vary this tone. He has to represent
what appears to be true in general opinion,
whether it be really true or not under certain conditions.
The dictum of Aristotle in regard to poetry&mdash;that
what appears probable, though in reality is
impossible, is better than what seems improbable
but is really possible&mdash;is equally true in painting.
In fact it is of more importance that this maxim
should be remembered in painting than in poetry,
because the signs of the painter are permanent. A
poet or novelist may refer to a passing exceptional
sun effect, for the impression on the mind of the
reader would probably be as transient as, or more
transient than, the effect itself, but with the painter
the transient effect becomes fixed. The blue arm is
always blue, and in a very short time becomes a
disagreeable unreality. It may be claimed that the
objectionable sun effects are not really exceptional,
though they are seldom noticed; but for the purpose
of art, what appears to be exceptional must be
definitely regarded as so, and for this reason dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>carded
by the artist who desires to paint a good
picture.</p>

<p>Generally then, the value of colour lies firstly in its
correspondence with nature, for upon this depends
its harmony and the assistance it lends to the recognition
of the beauty in the whole composition.
Beyond this it may or may not have an ephemeral
value according to local conditions. In any case
colour must ever be subordinated to design in a picture,
and this is what Poussin meant when he said
that particular attention to colour is an obstacle to
the art student.</p>

<h2><br />ILLUSIONS IN THE PAINTER'S ART</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>The painter is occupied in a perpetual struggle to
produce an illusion. He does not directly aim for
this, but except in the very highest art where ideals
are realized, the better the picture he paints, the
greater the illusion. The natural test of the value
of his work is its correspondence with nature, and
the nearer it so corresponds, the more complete the
illusion. But the whole picture is never an illusion
(we leave out of consideration those instances where
artificial devices are used to conceal the surroundings
of the actual painted surface), for the frame and other
material evidence inform us of the art. The illusion,
when it exists, is forced upon our minds from moment
to moment as our eyes travel over the work. It
occurs to us perhaps that a face "lives," that the
drapery is true to life, that the tones are real, and so
on, and obviously these circumstances cannot impress
us in this way unless we are momentarily
deceived. And it is a sign of good quality in the
work when we are so struck. This does not mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
that the closer the imitation, the better the picture:
on the contrary it is rare to find a good work of art
produced by an exact imitator. The duty of the
artist is to generalize everything that can be generalized
without departing from the character of the
thing represented. True there are degrees of generalization
which depend on the nature of the design,
the size of the work, the accessories, and other
matters, but if a just balance of generalization be
secured throughout, then the imitation is better
than a closely detailed reproduction, because a work
is always involuntarily judged from general, and not
from particular, experience. A portrait for instance
is a much better work of art if we can say of it "This
is a good portrait of a man," than if we are compelled
to confine ourselves to "This is a good portrait of
Mr. Jones," even if the lineaments of the particular
countenance are better defined in the latter example
than in the former. The illusion would be stronger,
for we are more intimately acquainted with "a
man" than with "Mr. Jones." And so with accessories.
An exceptionally fine rose or cabbage is never
so good in a painting as one of these articles which is
of an average type, because with this the illusion is
more certain, for it is not likely to be disturbed with
a mental inquiry into the unusual article.</p>

<p>The painter may produce his illusions then without
sacrificing anything in his art, and with the surety
that good paintings necessarily result in momentary
illusions except when form or expression above life
experience are dealt with.</p>

<p>The first and most important illusion in the art is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that of relief, for without this no other illusion can
be produced. It is a general condition applying to
all work on a flat surface. The other illusions that
may be provided are: (a) of opening distance in landscape;
(b) of motion in natural actions, as in flowing
water; (c) of human and animal actions; (d)
of suspension and motion in the air. The two first
are dealt with under "Landscape"; the others are
now considered.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>ILLUSION OF RELIEF</h3>


<p>The greatest value in the illusion of relief lies in
its assistance to recognition, for with the forms
rounded by shading and separated with the appearance
of relief which they have in nature, details of
the work are less likely to complicate the design to
the eye, than if the flat surface of the canvas be emphasized
by the avoidance of relief. For the eye
has to be considered before the mind, and it is of
immense importance that the brain should have the
least possible work to do in assisting the eye to
interpret a thing of art. It would appear then that
the minimum extent to which relief should be given
in a painting is that point below which the things
painted do not seem to have their three dimensions
indicated. Beyond this the painter is at liberty to
proceed as he pleases. Some great artists, notably
Lionardo, were inclined to think that it is impossible
to give too much relief to a figure, and this may be so
theoretically, but practically there is a line to be
drawn because life is limited, and after a certain
point is reached, the work of shading for relief is so
tedious an operation, that half a lifetime would be
required to execute a picture of three or four figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
if the artist wished to produce the strongest illusion
in his power to give. A Russian artist of high merit
who essayed the task, spent an average time of five
years in ceaseless toil on each figure he completed,
and even then frequently remarked that he had not
given to his figures the full relief he desired to exhibit.
It is well known that Lionardo gave long and
close attention to this matter in his pictures, and
he produced some extraordinary examples of relief,
of which the finest is, perhaps, the Litta Madonna,<a name="FNanchor_A_213" id="FNanchor_A_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_213" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
but one cannot help regretting that he did not rest
satisfied with a lower point of excellence in respect
of the illusion, so that he could spend more time in
general design.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>(See <a href="#Page_240">page 240</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the relief given by shading in painting,
there is an important mechanical method of improving
the illusion, though this can only be occasionally
adopted. The figures in any well painted
picture will appear to stand out in high relief if we
lose sight of the frame and other surroundings which
distinctly inform us that the work is a flat surface.
This is why a painting invariably seems to improve if
seen through a tube of such diameter that the frame
is excluded from the vision. Advantage of this fact
has been many times taken in the exhibition of
single pictures, when, by the exclusion of the frame,
the concealment of the edges of the work by curtain
arrangements, and the concentration of all the available
light upon the canvas, such perfect relief has
been obtained that observers have been sometimes
unable to distinguish the art from the life. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>the effect of the surroundings of a picture upon the
sight, that led to a practice in design resulting in the
exclusion of these surroundings to some extent when
the eye is directed towards the centre of the work
where the principal figure is commonly stationed.
This practice is to avoid accessories as far as possible
near the figure, and to provide considerable open
space above it, and also at the sides when the composition
allows, so that the observing eye has not of
necessity to range close to the frame of the picture.
In a good design of this kind the central figure or
figures come out in strong relief, the attraction of
the work being consequently much enhanced. Obviously
the painted figures should be of life size, or
nearly so, for the illusion of relief to be strikingly
marked, and the conditions necessarily prevent the
adoption of the scheme in a design of many figures.
It is most successful with a single figure, and has been
carried out with two figures, but never with more
than two except in a few pictures of great size.</p>

<p>The number of artists who have taken advantage
of this mechanical device is not large, but it includes
some of the first masters. The plan may be used in
both exterior and interior scenes. In the former the
figures must be thrown against the sky, and it is a
distinct advantage if there be no trees or other
objects on either side of the figures, which also stand
out above the horizon, though this is immaterial
if the figure be set in a confined space, as an arch, or
between the columns of a loggia, and the foliage is
not seen through this space.</p>

<p>The most famous pictures where the scheme is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
used in exterior work are amongst the finest portraits
known to us, namely, Lionardo's Mona Lisa, and
Raphael's Maddalena Doni and Angelo Doni.<a name="FNanchor_A_214" id="FNanchor_A_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_214" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> In
1504 or thereabouts, Lionardo painted a portrait of
Mona Lisa sitting in a loggia, the wall of which
reached to a third of the height of the canvas.<a name="FNanchor_B_215" id="FNanchor_B_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_215" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
On the wall at each side of the design is a column
divided down the centre by the edge of the canvas.
There is a landscape setting, in which the middle
distance is hidden by rising ground, and only part
of the head appears above the horizon. In 1505
Raphael made a study from this picture in which he
retained the columns, but raised the wall, and threw
the whole head of the figure against the sky. He
used this study for the portrait of Maddalena Doni,
but in this he still further improved the design by
removing the columns, and extending to the shoulders
that part of the figure above the horizon, the line of
which divides the picture in equal halves, instead
of being drawn at two thirds of the height as in
the first Mona Lisa. When Lionardo executed the
Louvre portrait of this lady, he removed the columns,
but slightly reduced the portion of the head seen
against the sky. Raphael's plan, which was also
used in the portrait of Angelo Doni, is obviously far
superior to that in the Mona Lisa design, for the
relief is necessarily better marked. The scheme was
not new to Raphael at the time, except in portraiture,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>for it is exhibited in three of his very early sacred
works.<a name="FNanchor_C_216" id="FNanchor_C_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_216" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>


<p>One of the best examples in existence of this method
of securing relief is Tintoretto's Presentation of the
Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_B_217" id="FNanchor_B_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_217" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> On the right of the picture is a wide flight
of stairs, curving round as they ascend. The Virgin
is moving up these steps in advance of some
attendants, and the curved stairway enables all the
figures to stand out in fine relief against the sky.
If well managed some considerable space above the
figures is sufficient for the illusion even if the sides
are partly closed, as in Albertinelli's beautiful
Salutation.<a name="FNanchor_C_218" id="FNanchor_C_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_218" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> Where only a small portion of the
figure can be shown above the horizon, the use of a
faint far distance helps in the scheme of relief.
Thus, in Marco Basaiti's Christ on the Mount of
Olives,<a name="FNanchor_D_219" id="FNanchor_D_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_219" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> where Christ stands on the top of a rock
which hides the middle distance, His head only is
above the horizon, but the rest of the figure is thrown
against a faint far distance, the relief being excellent.
A modification of this plan is observable in Lionardo's
Virgin and Child with St. Anne.<a name="FNanchor_E_220" id="FNanchor_E_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_220" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<p>So far as the writer has been able to ascertain, the
first known painting where a crucifix is thrown
against the sky is by Antonella da Messina.<a name="FNanchor_A_221" id="FNanchor_A_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_221" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> The
Cross is fixed in the foreground and extends to the
top of the picture, being cut half-way up and just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>below the feet of Christ by the line of the horizon.
The relief is very fine. This scheme was imitated
with more or less success but never quite so perfectly,
till Titian produced his magnificent Cross. Here the
Crucifix is cast against a sombre evening sky, with
the Virgin and two imploring Saints at the foot.<a name="FNanchor_B_222" id="FNanchor_B_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_222" class="fnanchor">[j]</a>
Rubens improved upon this design with several
variations. In one he hid the foot of the Cross,
though the tops of buildings are seen in the middle
distance<a name="FNanchor_C_223" id="FNanchor_C_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_223" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>; and in another, which is still finer, the
time of the scene is late evening, and dark vague outlines
suggest a landscape. But all these examples
are cast into the shade by Van Dyck's Antwerp
picture, than which there is certainly no more impressive
painted Crucifixion in existence. In this
the foot of the Cross is not shown, nor is there any
ground to be seen, and the figure stands out against
a dark forbidding sky, awful, but sublimely real, as
if set in boundless space for all eternity.<a name="FNanchor_D_224" id="FNanchor_D_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_224" class="fnanchor">[l]</a></p>

<p>There are many variations of the above designs,
particularly among the Works of Venetian artists,
but those quoted may be regarded as typical. How
easy it is to hinder the illusion is seen in Sodoma's
Sacrifice of Abraham,<a name="FNanchor_D_225" id="FNanchor_D_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_225" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> where both figures are set
against the sky, but trees behind them and at the
side destroy the relief, though the foliage is by no
means thick. In Girolami da Libri's Madonna and
Child with St. Anne, a pomegranate tree interposes<a name="FNanchor_E_226" id="FNanchor_E_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_226" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>;
and a curtain falls at the back of a group by Bernadino
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>da Conti,<a name="FNanchor_F_227" id="FNanchor_F_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_227" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> the illusion in both cases being consequently
robbed of its effect.</p>

<p>Some of the Dutch artists of the seventeenth century
used a clear sky for the purpose of enhancing
the relief of their figures, but as these are usually of
a comparatively small size, the result is only partially
effective. Albert Cuyp and Philip Wouverman
painted many pictures with men and animals
silhouetted above the horizon, and Paul Potter
executed a few of the kind, but of all Dutch painters,
Jan Steen secured the best relief with his Terrace
Scene.<a name="FNanchor_B_228" id="FNanchor_B_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_228" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> In more recent times the scheme has seldom
been adopted for the purpose of relief, but a few
Scottish painters practised it in the early nineteenth
century. Simson followed Cuyp's plan,<a name="FNanchor_C_229" id="FNanchor_C_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_229" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> and Dyce
in a sacred piece equalled the best of the old masters
in his manner of producing the illusion.<a name="FNanchor_D_230" id="FNanchor_D_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_230" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> Grant
also painted a fine example.<a name="FNanchor_E_231" id="FNanchor_E_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_231" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> Some portrait painters
of the English school of the eighteenth century used
the scheme in a partial way, but they commonly
placed clouds behind the figures thrown against the
sky, thus disturbing the illusion.</p>

<p>There is only one method of using this device for
assisting in the production of relief in interiors.
This is to throw the figure against a high wall which
is undecorated or nearly so. The figure must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>some little distance in front of the wall, and it is
observable that the best effect is obtained when the
light throughout the room is equal, but in any case
the wall should not have less light than the figure.
Inasmuch as the figure has to be of life size or nearly
so, to produce the desired result, a very large picture
would be necessary for the representation of a
standing adult; hence the plan is not attempted with
a life-size figure, except with a sitting adult or a
standing child. Before this scheme was used for the
human figure, that master of relief, M. A. Caravaggio,
adopted it for a simple still-life work.<a name="FNanchor_A_232" id="FNanchor_A_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_232" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> A
basket of fruit on a plain table, with a high bare wall
at the back&mdash;the canvas now sombre and darkened,
like the soul of the artist, but still remarkable for the
relief: this was the first application to interiors of a
plan which had been used in exteriors by some of the
greatest masters for more than a century.</p>

<p>So far as can be gathered from existing works,
thirty or forty years elapsed after the picture of
Caravaggio was painted before the scheme was
brought into use for the human figure in interiors.
In 1630, or thereabouts, Velasquez produced his
Christ at the Column.<a name="FNanchor_B_233" id="FNanchor_B_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_233" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> Here the wall is not actually
high, but Christ is shown seated on the floor, and
hence there is ample wall space over which the eye
may rove. It is possible that the adoption of the
plan in this instance was the result of accident, but
the very unusual pose of Christ hardly warrants the
suggestion. Velasquez painted no more pictures of
the kind till a quarter of a century later, when he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>produced Las Meninas. In this the relief is excellent,
but it would have been still better without the
picture on the wall, and the open door in the background,
though the figure seen on the steps through
the doorway lends assistance to the illusion.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the seventeenth century,
some followers of the Neapolitan school used the
plan occasionally, but the best existing Italian works
of the time where it is seen are from the hand of
Evaristo Baschenis, a Bergamese monk. He was an
excellent painter of still-life, and produced several
pictures, each with a boy or a woman seated in the
middle of a room near a plain table on which rests a
dish of fruit or a gathering of various articles, while
at the back there is a high bare wall. In all of these
works a fine relief is exhibited, though they are now
considerably marred by darkened shadows. A few
years later the plan was adopted by some Dutch
artists, and later still in France and Germany.
Chardin, who in more ways than one seems to have
been a French Baschenis, used it in several pictures.
In recent times since the study of Velasquez has
become a vogue, many artists have successfully
followed the plan, and one of the finest examples of
it in existence&mdash;Lydia Emmet's Patricia<a name="FNanchor_A_234" id="FNanchor_A_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_234" class="fnanchor">[v]</a>&mdash;dates as
late as 1915.</p>

<p>There are several minor mechanical ways of enhancing
relief, most of them providing a setting which
acts as a kind of inner frame to the design, the object
being to reduce the effect of the actual frame in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>disturbing the illusion. Portrait painters of the
Dutch, Flemish, and English schools, have often
placed half length figures in painted ovals on canvas
rectangles, and in the case of Hals he sometimes
further improved the illusion by extending a hand
of the subject over the oval. Hanneman used this
oval in a most exceptional way. On a large canvas
he painted the bust portraits of Constantine Huygens
and his six children, each in a separate oval,
the father being in the centre.<a name="FNanchor_A_235" id="FNanchor_A_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_235" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> The scheme is
strangely effective, for the attention of the observer
is involuntarily confined to one portrait at a time.
In genre pictures a doorway may act as the inner
frame, but this is only of material value if the picture
be of considerable size. The Dutch painters, notably
Gerard Dow, loved to paint figures leaning over
window-sills, this method usually enhancing the
relief, because the eye is apt to be confined for a
time to the window-frame. Perhaps the best use of
a window for the purpose of relief is Rembrandt's
Samson Menacing His Father-in-law, where the
old man's head and hands, of life size, are seen protruding
from a small window.<a name="FNanchor_B_236" id="FNanchor_B_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_236" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>ILLUSION OF MOTION</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">With human figures&mdash;With animals.</p>


<p>From the earliest times great sculptors, in producing
a single figure in action, have chosen for the
representation a moment of rest between two steps
in the action, so that the character of these steps is
instantly recognized by the observer, whose imagination
unconsciously carries through the action. If
every part of the figure is built up conformably with
the action, with due regard to the position from which
the statue is to be seen, an illusion of motion will
follow, though this is necessarily so rapid that the
effect upon the observer is indirect: he translates the
impression into appreciation of the lifelike attitude
of the figure. Nearly all the ancient Greek sculptured
figures known to us, commencing with those
of Myron, are characterized by this excellence in
design, and so with the best work of the Italian
Renaissance. Modern sculptors of repute have also
endeavoured to provide the illusion, Rodin in particular
holding that it should be the aim of every
sculptor.<a name="Eanchor_69" id="Eanchor_69"></a><a href="#Enote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The painter is in a different position from the
sculptor because the latter may design his figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
with special reference to the position it is to occupy,
and so he can in a measure compel the observer to
see it in a particular way. Thus, the base of the
statue may be some height above the ground, in
which case the observer must necessarily run his eyes
up the figure from the feet; or it may be seen first
in a three-quarter view so that the position of the
limbs will apparently change as the observer moves to
the front. Such accidental circumstances may be
considered by the sculptor in his plan. The painter
has no such advantage, for his figure is the same from
whichever point it is to be seen, within reasonable
limits; but he has compensation in the use of tones
and accessories of which the sculptor is deprived.
That the painter may provide an excellent illusion
with a single figure in action is evidenced by Raphael's
superb St. Margaret, where the Saint is seen
stepping over the dragon.<a name="FNanchor_A_237" id="FNanchor_A_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_237" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Every part of her body,
and every fold of drapery is used in the expression
of movement, the effect being so perfect that we
cannot disassociate the figure from the action.<a name="Eanchor_70" id="Eanchor_70"></a><a href="#Enote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>


<p>The painters of the first century of the Renaissance
never properly represented a figure in the act
of walking, and there are few pictures even of the
fifteenth century where a serious attempt is made to
choose the best moment in which to exhibit such a
figure. The first successful essay in the task seems
to have been in The Tribute Money of Masaccio,<a name="FNanchor_A_238" id="FNanchor_A_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_238" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
who indeed was fifty years ahead of his fellows in
the faithful representation of action. There was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>jump of two decades or so after Masaccio to the
next good figure, which was that of an attendant in
Filipo Lippi's complex tondo at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_B_239" id="FNanchor_B_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_239" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> This
figure must have caused considerable surprise at the
time, for it was copied into several works by subsequent
artists, notably Domenico Ghirlandaio,<a name="FNanchor_C_240" id="FNanchor_C_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_240" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
and probably suggested the fine figure carrying a
jar of water on her head in Raphael's Fire at the
Borgo.<a name="FNanchor_D_241" id="FNanchor_D_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_241" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> But Raphael, who mastered every problem
in composition, solved this one so completely that he
left nothing for his successors to learn respecting it.
Not only are the limbs of his moving figures so perfectly
arranged that we see only action, but folds of
the drapery used on the figures are sufficient to indicate
preceding movements,<a name="FNanchor_E_242" id="FNanchor_E_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_242" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> and this is so even
when the figures are stationary, but the head, arms,
or upper part of the body have moved.<a name="FNanchor_F_243" id="FNanchor_F_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_243" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> This extraordinary
feature of Raphael's work will ever form
a subject of astonishment and admiration.</p>


<p>The painter has a comparatively easy task in presenting
an illusion with several figures presumed to
be moving, for he has only to comply with two simple
conditions. The first is that the particular step
represented in the act of progression of any individual
should vary from the steps of the persons immediately
behind or in front of him; and secondly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>that the actions of the different persons be connected
with each other so far as possible. With these
conditions reasonably fulfilled, illusion of motion
necessarily follows. Naturally in such a mechanical
matter, the character of the invention depends upon
the scale of the design. When the moving figures
are presumed to be comparatively near at hand, the
position of the limbs must be entirely presented, or
the progression will appear broken. The effective
illusion presented in Burne-Jones's Golden Staircase
is due to his ingenuity in so arranging the numerous
figures descending the winding stairs, that all their
feet are visible. In the case of a crowd of figures of
whom some are supposed to be moving and others
standing still, the visibility of the limbs is of less
importance than the connection of the various
actions. In Menzel's Market in Verona,<a name="FNanchor_A_244" id="FNanchor_A_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_244" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> the illusion,
which is remarkable, is entirely produced by
the skill in which innumerable instances of action are
made dependent upon others. An illusion is created
in the same way though in a lesser degree by Gustave
Dor&eacute; in several works.<a name="FNanchor_B_245" id="FNanchor_B_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_245" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> When the motion
arises from the actions of the arms of a number of
persons, it suffices if the arms are in various positions,
as in Menzel's Iron Mill, and Cavalori's Woolworkers<a name="FNanchor_C_246" id="FNanchor_C_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_246" class="fnanchor">[j]</a>
where many men are using long tools; but if the
limbs are working together, an illusion is impossible.
The beauty of Guardi's great picture, Regatta on the
Grand Canal, is much diminished by the attitude of
the gondoliers, who all hold their poles in the same
position.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>Where many persons are moving together in the
same direction, great care has to be exercised in presenting
the actions conformably with the rate at
which the movement is proceeding, for upon this of
course depends the angles of the bended knees, and
the extent to which some of the feet may be carried
from the ground. In slow natural movements, as
where a number of men are dragging a heavy burden,
it is rare to find an artist wrong in his representation<a name="FNanchor_A_247" id="FNanchor_A_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_247" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>;
but in the case of numerous figures walking irregularly,
a true nearground design is uncommon, the
painter usually giving insufficient action, with the
result that his figures present a stagy appearance.<a name="FNanchor_B_248" id="FNanchor_B_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_248" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>
But a defect of this kind is not so serious as where
several men, not being in marching order, are moving
in the same direction with their feet in similar positions,
and each with a foot off the ground,<a name="FNanchor_C_249" id="FNanchor_C_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_249" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> for this
is only an aggravation of a case where the picture
shows but a single figure walking with one foot in
the air.</p>

<p>An illusion of motion may be given to a line of
figures in the middle distance of a landscape by
simply winding the road along which they pass<a name="FNanchor_D_250" id="FNanchor_D_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_250" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>;
but the angles of the turns must be large, for when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>they are small, or when there is a distinct zigzag,
the illusion is destroyed through the lengthy operation
of the eye in comprehending the whole scene.</p>

<p>When many figures are moving close together,
even if they be marching to the same step, an illusion
of movement may be given by the representation
of a flying figure proceeding in the same direction.
This scheme has been adopted in sculpture with
high success, as in the Shaw Memorial at Boston,<a name="FNanchor_A_251" id="FNanchor_A_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_251" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
and the Marseillaise of Rude.<a name="FNanchor_B_252" id="FNanchor_B_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_252" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> In painting, several
horizontal figures may be used, but they must be
placed irregularly to avoid the appearance of formality.
Some modern French artists are responsible
for effective designs indicating the arrival of spring
by an overhead figure flying above young people
moving through flowery fields.<a name="FNanchor_C_253" id="FNanchor_C_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_253" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>A suggestion of motion may be obtained by exhibiting
a number of persons engaged in similar actions,
but shown in a consecutive series of stages thereof.
This plan is admirably worked out by Watteau in his
Embarkation for Cythera.<a name="FNanchor_D_254" id="FNanchor_D_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_254" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> A line of couples commences
at the right of the picture, proceeds towards
the left, and then descends a slope to the place of
embarkation. The first couple are sitting and conversing,
the next are in the act of rising, and the
third have just risen and are about to follow the
other couples already walking, the whole device
being most effective. A similar kind of illusion is
caused by Rubens in his Diana and Nymphs pursued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>by Satyrs.<a name="FNanchor_E_255" id="FNanchor_E_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_255" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> On the extreme right of the picture
some of the figures are stationary; then come a few
who are struggling, and finally some running nymphs
and satyrs, a perfect progression of events being
suggested.</p>

<p>Illusion of motion is more easily obtained with
animals than with human figures, providing they
are fairly large, because of the greater number of
their feet and the consequent wider variation between
the apparent and the real movements. It is
exceedingly difficult to produce a suggestion of motion
with a single animal represented in a natural
attitude, but the painter is only concerned with what
appears to be natural or probable, and not with
what is actually so. We have only a general idea of
the action of a horse in nature from what we see,
and consequently in design this action must be
generalized irrespective of natural possibilities. Some
artists combine parts of different actions as exhibited
in a series of photographs in order to represent a
moment of action as it is generalized to the eye, but
this is only serviceable where the presumed action of
the animal is one of a series of similar events, as in
walking or trotting. It would not answer in the case
of an isolated action, as jumping or rearing, because
such actions vary with the circumstances surrounding
them, as the height of the jump or the cause of the
rearing. In these events therefore the artist may
exaggerate to a great extent without appearing to
present impossible movements. In fact nearly all
good pictures of one or two horses in action are strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>exaggerations of nature, but this hardly affects their
&aelig;sthetic worth because the action is not recognized
as abnormal or impossible. The finest painting of
horses in action known to us, is Regnault's Automedon
with the Horses of Achilles,<a name="FNanchor_A_256" id="FNanchor_A_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_256" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> where the animals
exhibit spirit and movement far above experience,
but even if we did not know that they are presumed
to be immortal, we should only regard the action as
exceptional, for it does not appear to be impossible.</p>

<p>There is ample scope for the presentation of an
illusion with a number of moving animals. All that
is necessary is that they should be kept fairly well
together with their legs in various moving attitudes.
This illusion is perfectly managed by many of the
French painters of battle scenes in the nineteenth
century, notably Horace Vernet,<a name="FNanchor_B_257" id="FNanchor_B_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_257" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
Gros,<a name="FNanchor_C_258" id="FNanchor_C_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_258" class="fnanchor">[v]</a>
Chartier,<a name="FNanchor_D_259" id="FNanchor_D_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_259" class="fnanchor">[w]</a>
Morot,<a name="FNanchor_E_260" id="FNanchor_E_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_260" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> and Meissonier.<a name="FNanchor_F_261" id="FNanchor_F_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_261" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> The action in the cavalry
charges of Morot and Chartier is amazingly true
to life. Even three or four animals will suffice for
an illusion,<a name="FNanchor_G_262" id="FNanchor_G_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_262" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> but this cannot be provided with the
smaller animals, as sheep or goats, because although
a series of progressive actions may be given to those
outside animals in a flock whose legs are visible to
the spectator of the picture, the scale to which they
are painted is necessarily so small that the eye has an
entirely insufficient range for operating the illusion.
Where several horses are represented as moving at
considerable speed, it is necessary that some of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>feet should touch the ground, otherwise the illusion
is destroyed, or else the animal may appear to be
racing through the air.<a name="FNanchor_H_263" id="FNanchor_H_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_263" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a> The effect is not so disturbing
when all the feet of the moving animals are
on the ground,<a name="FNanchor_I_264" id="FNanchor_I_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_264" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a> or where they are hidden by herbage,<a name="FNanchor_J_265" id="FNanchor_J_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_265" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a>
or where all the animals are on their hind
legs,<a name="FNanchor_K_266" id="FNanchor_K_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_266" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a> though in these instances an illusion is almost
impossible.</p>

<p>In cases where horses and men are crowded together,
and are struggling in confusion, it is only
necessary in order to provide an illusion, that no
action should be entirely separated from the others.
There was a fine example of this work in a lost drawing
or painting of Titian, of Pharaoh's Host Overwhelmed
in the Red Sea<a name="FNanchor_E_267" id="FNanchor_E_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_267" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a>; and many artists of the
Renaissance produced like illusions in pictures of the
rape of the Sabines. Where the movement is spread
over a large area, and the scale to which the animals
are drawn is comparatively small, the various groups
engaged must obviously be connected together in a
series. Franz Adam arranges a scheme of this kind
in a battle scene, using running soldiers or hauled
guns as links in the chain.<a name="FNanchor_F_268" id="FNanchor_F_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_268" class="fnanchor">[af]</a></p>

<p>An illusion of motion is sometimes assisted by
the title of the picture. A remarkable example of
this is Robert's The Israelites Depart. Although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>individual action cannot be distinguished owing to
the scale of the design, yet when one is acquainted
with the title, the imagination is instinctively set
to work, and the enormous crowds packing the wide
streets seem to be streaming in one direction. Obviously
for the title to have this effect, the number
of signs must be overwhelming, and there must be
no possibility of interpreting the picture in two ways;
that is to say, accessory signs must be used to indicate
the direction in which the crowd is moving.<a name="Eanchor_71" id="Eanchor_71"></a><a href="#Enote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<h3>ILLUSION OF SUSPENSION AND MOTION IN THE AIR</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">With the assistance of drapery&mdash;Of clouds&mdash;Of winged figures&mdash;Miscellaneous
devices.</p>


<p>The representation of figures suspended in the air,
or moving through it, has never offered much trouble
to painters, though necessarily involving an apparent
miracle. The very slightest pretended physical
assistance suffices for the illusion, and this help is
usually rendered in the shape of flying drapery,
winged figures, clouds, or artificial devices based
upon the contact of two or more figures. The only
difficulty met with is in respect of an upward vertical
movement. Here, wings or clouds can scarcely be
made to differentiate between a rising and a falling
movement, and flying drapery is of little service
inasmuch as a rush through the air would, if the feat
were actually performed, cause the drapery to cling
to the figure. The surest remedy for the disabilty is to
support the figure directly by winged figures placed at
a considerable angle from the vertical, but this plan is
only rarely adopted by great masters because of the
consequent complications in the design of the group.
Since flying drapery is commonly added to the figure
presumed to be ascending, and seeing that artists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
almost invariably insist upon giving their ascending
figures upright attitudes, it is seldom that the movement
is correctly expressed. Usually the figure
appears to be held immovably in suspension, but
occasionally, owing to the drapery arrangement, a
descending movement is indicated.<a name="FNanchor_A_269" id="FNanchor_A_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_269" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Without the
assistance of winged figures, the illusion of ascension
can only be given when the figure is shown directed
upwards at an angle of at least fifteen or twenty
degrees from the vertical. As a rule the larger the
angle, the more easy is the production of an illusion.
With a fairly large angle, and an appropriate arrangement
of limbs and drapery, heavy figures can be
made to appear naturally ascending, as in Rubens's
Boreas and Orithyia, both voluptuous forms.<a name="FNanchor_B_270" id="FNanchor_B_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_270" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>


<p>Only a very few of the first artists have been able
to give an illusion of movement in the air by use of
drapery alone, the device adopted by Michelangelo
in the Sistine Chapel frescoes being perhaps the most
effective. He throws behind the moving figure of the
Deity a large fold of drapery, which assumes an oval
or nearly round shape, the whole acting as a concave
framework for the Deity and attending Angels.<a name="FNanchor_A_271" id="FNanchor_A_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_271" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The success of the plan arises of course from the
apparent resistance to the air offered by a large
and compact surface. This form with more or less
marked modifications in the concavity was probably
used by the ancient Greeks in their paintings, as a
nearly similar arrangement is found in a sculptured
figure which has come down to us, though in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>case a running movement is indicated.<a name="FNanchor_B_272" id="FNanchor_B_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_272" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
It is also seen in some Pompeian frescoes, where it is applied
to figures moving through the air and on the ground.<a name="FNanchor_C_273" id="FNanchor_C_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_273" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Raphael adopted the device occasionally,<a name="FNanchor_D_274" id="FNanchor_D_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_274" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> but generally
varied it with excellent effect by flowing out
from the waist a large scarf-like fold to take a circular
form above the head and shoulders of the figure,<a name="FNanchor_E_275" id="FNanchor_E_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_275" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> or
by causing heavy drapery to flow out from the lower
part of the body.<a name="FNanchor_F_276" id="FNanchor_F_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_276" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> No doubt in the case of Raphael,
the extraordinary grace of figure, and the perfect pose
of the limbs, assist the illusion. Tintoretto and other
artists of the Renaissance used an oval drapery in
a similar way; while sometimes the figure is half
hidden within it,<a name="FNanchor_G_277" id="FNanchor_G_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_277" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> and Le Sueur wrapped part of the
figure in folds before forming the oval.<a name="FNanchor_H_278" id="FNanchor_H_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_278" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> There seems
to be a simple virtue in any oval form connected with
figures presumed to be suspended in the air. It was
quite common in the early days of the Renaissance
for the Deity or Virgin and Child to be placed in a
regular oval framework, sometimes supported by
Angels or cherubs, and the illusion was usually successful.<a name="FNanchor_I_279" id="FNanchor_I_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_279" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Rubens by way of experiment went a little
further in one picture, for he placed the Virgin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Child in an oval picture frame supported by cherubs.<a name="FNanchor_J_280" id="FNanchor_J_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_280" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>
This however does not seem so novel as some of
Perugino's ovals which are bordered with the heads
of cherubs.<a name="FNanchor_K_281" id="FNanchor_K_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_281" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p>Wings are seldom sufficient to suggest lightness in
the air, because they can scarcely be designed of the
size and strength which we judge to be proportionate
to the presumed weight of the body, without making
the form appear abnormal, though there are instances
in which partial success has been achieved by using
comparatively small figures and giving them unusually
large wings.<a name="FNanchor_C_282" id="FNanchor_C_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_282" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> The use of more than a single
pair of wings is hardly permissible because of the
apparent anomaly. Actually one pair is not less
incomprehensible from an anatomical point of view
than several pairs, but custom has driven from our
minds any suggestion of incongruity in respect of
the representation of the common type of Angel.
Naturally when skilfully arranged, the more wings,
the stronger the illusion of flight, and if a habit of
giving four wings to an Angel were engendered, we
should perhaps see nothing strange in them. Even
six wings have been given to Angels without making
them appear ungraceful.<a name="FNanchor_D_283" id="FNanchor_D_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_283" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<p>When there is no assistance, as clouds or flowing
drapery, lent to Angels to promote the illusion of
suspension, it is necessary to give them an attitude
which is nearly horizontal. Properly managed, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>pair of comparatively small wings may in this way
appear to support a heavy form.<a name="FNanchor_A_284" id="FNanchor_A_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_284" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> Luini actually
adds the weight of the body of St. Catherine to three
Angels, flying horizontally, who carry her to the
tomb<a name="FNanchor_B_285" id="FNanchor_B_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_285" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>; an invention, strangely enough, followed by
Kulmbach in Germany at about the same time.<a name="FNanchor_C_286" id="FNanchor_C_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_286" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> In
both cases the illusion is excellent. Some of the
early Flemish and German masters, including Van
Eyck<a name="FNanchor_D_287" id="FNanchor_D_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_287" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> and Holbein,<a name="FNanchor_E_288" id="FNanchor_E_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_288" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> employed Angels in scenes with
the Virgin to hold suspended behind her seat, large
falls of brocaded material, and it is curious to note
that the Angels themselves seem to be supported
by the drapery. In order to assist the suggestion
of lightness, Perugino sometimes arched the lower
limbs of the Angels, adding a narrow tape scroll<a name="FNanchor_F_289" id="FNanchor_F_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_289" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>;
an addition improved upon by Raphael who substituted
for the scroll a loosened girdle flying out
from the waist.<a name="FNanchor_G_290" id="FNanchor_G_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_290" class="fnanchor">[v]</a></p>

<p>The most frequently used form of support for
figures in suspension are irregular masses of clouds,
upon which the figures sit or stand, and occasionally
are partly enfolded therein. Sometimes the cloud
bank is more or less shaped for the purpose of relief,
or for variety in design. Thus, Raphael makes part
of the cloud a perfect footrest for the Virgin,<a name="FNanchor_A_291" id="FNanchor_A_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_291" class="fnanchor">[w]</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>Palma Giovane does a similar thing for a figure of
Christ,<a name="FNanchor_B_292" id="FNanchor_B_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_292" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> but in this case the illusion is hazarded as
the seat is not directly indicated. Ingres produces
an excellent illusion by making the footrest a small
separate cloud,<a name="FNanchor_C_293" id="FNanchor_C_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_293" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> which is a variation from the practice
of many painters of the Renaissance, who used a
separate cloud for each personage in the composition,
or even with each foot as with Carlo Crivelli.<a name="FNanchor_D_294" id="FNanchor_D_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_294" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
In a fresco of the Evangelists at Florence, each of
them sits with his insignia on a foliated bank of
clouds.<a name="FNanchor_E_295" id="FNanchor_E_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_295" class="fnanchor">[aa]</a> Perugino in using a similar plan sometimes
places the clouds at the bottom of the picture, no
part of the earth being seen, so that the illusion is
considerably enhanced.<a name="FNanchor_F_296" id="FNanchor_F_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_296" class="fnanchor">[ab]</a> At other times he shows
Angels apparently running through the air, with
each front foot resting on a tiny cloud, giving the
impression that it is fastened there.<a name="FNanchor_G_297" id="FNanchor_G_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_297" class="fnanchor">[ac]</a> Durer extended
this plan by directly attaching a small cloud
to each foot, the effect being somewhat whimsical.<a name="FNanchor_H_298" id="FNanchor_H_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_298" class="fnanchor">[ad]</a>
Titian was unsuccessful in the use of an isolated
cloud.<a name="FNanchor_I_299" id="FNanchor_I_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_299" class="fnanchor">[ae]</a> In a Resurrection scene Christ stands on a
small thin cloud, and holds a flag-pole, the lower end
of which rests upon the cloud. Obviously with such
a design no suggestion of ascent can enter the mind.</p>

<p>Some artists, as Luca Signorelli,<a name="FNanchor_A_300" id="FNanchor_A_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_300" class="fnanchor">[af]</a> hide the lower
part of the figure behind clouds, but this method,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>while indicating suspension, cannot provide an illusion
of movement without an assisting device. Thus
Schonherr shows an Angel so concealed in a nearly
horizontal position with wings fully expanded, the
effect being good.<a name="FNanchor_B_301" id="FNanchor_B_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_301" class="fnanchor">[ag]</a> When a figure is suspended on
clouds, very rarely indeed is repose emphasized by
placing it in a horizontal position, but Poussin once
adopts the plan,<a name="FNanchor_C_302" id="FNanchor_C_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_302" class="fnanchor">[ah]</a> and Guercino goes so far as to
represent a reclining Angel resting her head on her
hand as if suffering from fatigue.<a name="FNanchor_D_303" id="FNanchor_D_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_303" class="fnanchor">[ai]</a> Perfect repose
of the Deity in an upright position on clouds is produced
by Gustave Dor&eacute;, who reduces the size of the
earth, above which He stands, to an insignificant
proportion, so that the imagination sends it moving
round below Him.<a name="FNanchor_E_304" id="FNanchor_E_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_304" class="fnanchor">[aj]</a></p>

<p>Quite a number of artists represent the suspended
figures standing on the backs of cherubs or cupids,
which in their turn are supported by clouds, as
for instance, R. Ghirlandaio,<a name="FNanchor_A_305" id="FNanchor_A_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_305" class="fnanchor">[ak]</a> Liberale di Verona,<a name="FNanchor_B_306" id="FNanchor_B_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_306" class="fnanchor">[al]</a>
and Francesco da Cotignola.<a name="FNanchor_C_307" id="FNanchor_C_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_307" class="fnanchor">[am]</a> Fra Bartolommeo
places a single foot of the Deity on a cherub who
holds a banderole, the illusion being excellent.<a name="FNanchor_D_308" id="FNanchor_D_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_308" class="fnanchor">[an]</a>
Domenichino adopts a most ingenious device in
St. Paul's Vision. He shows the Apostle being
carried to Heaven by winged cherubs, who appear
to find the weight considerable, and to struggle
under it. There is little else to induce the illusion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>which is complete.<a name="FNanchor_E_309" id="FNanchor_E_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_309" class="fnanchor">[ao]</a> A similar scheme is successfully
managed in Prud'hon's Abduction of Psyche.
Tassaert uses a like device, but in addition has a
cherub supporting each arm of the Virgin. Palma
Vecchio makes the Virgin stand on the outstretched
wings of a cherub, but her robe blows upwards,
giving her the appearance of descending instead of
ascending.<a name="FNanchor_F_310" id="FNanchor_F_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_310" class="fnanchor">[ap]</a> Rubens has three alternatives in the
use of cherubs. The figure sits on clouds with feet
resting on small globes sustained by cherubs<a name="FNanchor_G_311" id="FNanchor_G_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_311" class="fnanchor">[aq]</a>; or
the cherubs hold the dress and mantle of the Virgin;
or they help to control the clouds upon which she
sits.<a name="FNanchor_H_312" id="FNanchor_H_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_312" class="fnanchor">[ar]</a> In some of his pictures of the Immaculate
Conception, Murillo also uses globes, but places the
cherubs on them instead of under. Francia has a
picture in which cherubs hold up clouds bearing the
Virgin,<a name="FNanchor_I_313" id="FNanchor_I_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_313" class="fnanchor">[as]</a> a device once used by Rembrandt.<a name="FNanchor_J_314" id="FNanchor_J_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_314" class="fnanchor">[at]</a> Genga
shows the Deity kneeling upon the heads of cherubs,
a scheme not satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_K_315" id="FNanchor_K_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_315" class="fnanchor">[au]</a> Cherubs were used by
Titian to hold up the Virgin and clouds,<a name="FNanchor_L_316" id="FNanchor_L_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_316" class="fnanchor">[av]</a> while
Velasquez rested the robes on clouds, but used cherubs
to sustain the Holy Mother.<a name="FNanchor_M_317" id="FNanchor_M_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_317" class="fnanchor">[aw]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>The illusion is usually more complete when Angels
are used instead of cherubs for support, apparently
because they may be presumed to have greater
strength, and the plan was adopted by some of the
earlier masters of the Renaissance. The simple design
of Rubens in resting the foot of Christ on the arm
of a flying Angel is quite successful.<a name="FNanchor_A_318" id="FNanchor_A_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_318" class="fnanchor">[ax]</a> Fontana places
the Deity on clouds supported by Angels,<a name="FNanchor_B_319" id="FNanchor_B_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_319" class="fnanchor">[ay]</a> a method
adopted by Granacci, who however assists the illusion
by adding two Angels who are directly supporting
the figure.<a name="FNanchor_C_320" id="FNanchor_C_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_320" class="fnanchor">[az]</a> Peter Cornelius has the Deity with
His foot on a small globe which is held in position
by Angels.<a name="FNanchor_D_321" id="FNanchor_D_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_321" class="fnanchor">[ba]</a> A fine example of their use is shown by
Gutherz. Two Angels with large outstretched wings
are bearing the body of a woman to Heaven. She
lies recumbent upon a lengthy hammock formed by
the robes of the Angels, the ends of the drapery
being gathered up by the flying cherubs.<a name="FNanchor_E_322" id="FNanchor_E_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_322" class="fnanchor">[bb]</a> The
illusion is perfect. Rembrandt also has a beautiful
design in a Resurrection scene, for he shows the
figure of Christ as a shade whose hands are held by a
flying Angel lifting Him to Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_F_323" id="FNanchor_F_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_323" class="fnanchor">[bc]</a> A few artists,
as Poussin<a name="FNanchor_G_324" id="FNanchor_G_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_324" class="fnanchor">[bd]</a> and Bouguereau,<a name="FNanchor_H_325" id="FNanchor_H_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_325" class="fnanchor">[be]</a> use Angels to carry
the figure with no other assisting device, but if
the body is recumbent it is necessary that the
Angels should be in a nearly upright position, otherwise
they will appear to be moving horizontally.<a name="FNanchor_I_326" id="FNanchor_I_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_326" class="fnanchor">[bf]</a>
Rubens in an Ascension uses the strange method
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>of placing an Angel beneath Christ, but without
touching Him.<a name="FNanchor_J_327" id="FNanchor_J_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_327" class="fnanchor">[bg]</a> The drapery flies out at the back,
so that without some assistance he would appear
to be descending; but the Angel below, with her
hands held up, seems to correct the position. Guido
Reni carries the Virgin up with Angels who support
her beneath, and she seems in fact to be standing
on their shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_K_328" id="FNanchor_K_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_328" class="fnanchor">[bh]</a> In one instance Correggio substitutes
a smiling boy for an Angel, and he holds up
a cloud on which the Virgin sits.<a name="FNanchor_L_329" id="FNanchor_L_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_329" class="fnanchor">[bi]</a> There are many
works where winged figures hold a body in suspension,
most of them providing excellent illusions. Among
the best is Lux's Sarpedon, where the body of the
Trojan is held up for Jupiter to kiss.<a name="FNanchor_M_330" id="FNanchor_M_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_330" class="fnanchor">[bj]</a></p>

<p>Even a simple banderole or scarf suffices to indicate
movement in the air if well arranged. Usually
a flying cherub holds an end of the banderole, and
Ferri shows a wingless putto even, flying with no
other assistance.<a name="FNanchor_E_331" id="FNanchor_E_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_331" class="fnanchor">[bk]</a> Boucher creates an illusion by
the bold device of connecting two cupids with a
narrow scarf blown out into a semicircle<a name="FNanchor_F_332" id="FNanchor_F_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_332" class="fnanchor">[bl]</a>; and in
another instance very narrow tape streamers suffice.<a name="FNanchor_G_333" id="FNanchor_G_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_333" class="fnanchor">[bm]</a></p>

<p>The use of thick smoke for suspension purposes is
nearly always successful, because volumes of smoke
in nature necessarily tend to move upwards; but
obviously this scheme can only be arranged when
an altar is possible. The plan is not uncommon in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>pictures relating to Cain and Abel, and the Translation
of Enoch. In one of the latter subject, Hoet
makes part of the smoke from an altar envelop the
surrounding ground so as to widen the volume, while
Schnorr achieves the same end by curling round the
smoke as it ascends into the form of a large saucer
upon which the Deity sits,<a name="FNanchor_A_334" id="FNanchor_A_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_334" class="fnanchor">[bn]</a> a method slightly varied
by Amiconi.<a name="FNanchor_B_335" id="FNanchor_B_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_335" class="fnanchor">[bo]</a></p>

<p>Where a number of figures are connected together
in a circular form in the air, the double illusion of
suspension and motion follows naturally, provided
their attitudes indicate a circular movement. An
excellent example of this is shown in a picture by
Botticelli, where Angels dance in the air over the
hut of the Nativity.<a name="FNanchor_C_336" id="FNanchor_C_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_336" class="fnanchor">[bp]</a> The finest work of the kind
in existence is probably Schwind's Pleiads, in which
the stars are represented by a circle of beautiful
nude women.<a name="FNanchor_D_337" id="FNanchor_D_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_337" class="fnanchor">[bq]</a> Extraordinary activity is suggested
by the perfect arrangement of the limbs and light
flowing drapery used. Bouguereau has a work
of a similar kind, The Lost Pleiad, but here the
dancers are upright, and the circle is only accessory
to the title figure.<a name="FNanchor_E_338" id="FNanchor_E_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_338" class="fnanchor">[br]</a> Watteau is fairly successful
in giving an illusion of suspension to cupids even
with a half circle, though the invention is somewhat
formal.<a name="FNanchor_F_339" id="FNanchor_F_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_339" class="fnanchor">[bs]</a></p>

<p>Some of the devices used to bring about an illusion
are most ingenious. Thus in his Bacchus and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Ariadne,<a name="FNanchor_A_340" id="FNanchor_A_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_340" class="fnanchor">[bt]</a> Tintoretto actually applies a disability of
his art for the purpose. Venus is shown in a horizontal
position in the air, placing a crown of stars
upon the head of Ariadne. Bacchus is standing by,
and the form of the goddess floats just at the back
of him, the lower side of her hip being on a level with
the top of his head. Seeing that the head is covered
with a profusion of vine leaves, it is impossible for
the artist to indicate, or the observer to recognize,
that the goddess does not actually touch the head of
Bacchus, and she apparently balances herself upon
his head while crowning Ariadne, the artist having
been careful to place the centre of gravity of
her figure over the apparent point of contact. A
similar kind of illusion is provided by Burne-Jones,
whose Angel of the Annunciation is upright in midair
near the ground, but her feet seem to find support
on the branches of a shrub.<a name="FNanchor_B_341" id="FNanchor_B_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_341" class="fnanchor">[bu]</a> Rossetti, in the same
subject, shows the Angel with his feet wrapped in
flames, the weight being thus apparently removed.
The design seems bizarre, perhaps because of the
absence of an expression of surprise which one would
expect to see on the countenance of the Virgin at
so extraordinary a phenomenon.<a name="Eanchor_73" id="Eanchor_73"></a><a href="#Enote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Schwind also
uses a disability of his art for an illusion in his Phantom
of the Forest.<a name="FNanchor_C_342" id="FNanchor_C_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_342" class="fnanchor">[bv]</a> She moves near the ground
away from the spectator with such rapidity that her
robe, a simple rectangular piece of drapery, has
opened out wide from the front, and hides her figure
from the shoulders down, so that from the point of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>view of the observer she may, or may not, be touching
the ground as she moves.</p>

<p>How slight the apparent support need be, is indicated
in Bouguereau's Aurora and Twilight. Each
figure is represented by a nude woman holding a
light scarf, the first rapidly, and the second slowly,
skimming the surface of a stream of water with soft
touches of the feet, and yet there is no anomaly
that strikes the mind. A still more daring device is
used by Battistello, though quite successfully. He
places two wingless putti in the air, but one holds up
the other, and this action seems to sustain them both.<a name="FNanchor_A_343" id="FNanchor_A_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_343" class="fnanchor">[bw]</a>
Another amazing design is from the hand of A. P.
Roll, who shows a nude-man in the air clutching
another, and apparently struggling to pull him down,
yet the action seems perfectly natural.<a name="FNanchor_B_344" id="FNanchor_B_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_344" class="fnanchor">[bx]</a></p>

<p>It is usual and proper to distinguish three kinds of
beauty in painting, namely, of colour, of form, and of
expression. But form must be defined by tones, and
colour without form is meaningless: hence in the general
consideration of the painter's art, it is convenient to
place form and colour together as representing the
sensorial element of beauty. Nevertheless colour and
form are not on the same plane in regard to sense perception.
Harmony of colour is distinguished involuntarily
by nerve sensations, but in the case of harmony
of form there must be a certain consideration before its
&aelig;sthetic determination. The recognition of this harmony
commonly appears to be instantaneous, but still
it is delayed, the delay varying with the complexity of
the signs, that is to say, with the quality of the beauty.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br /><a name="Enote_2" id="Enote_2"></a><a href="#Eanchor_2">NOTE 2. PAGE 2</a></h4>

<p>Benedetto Croce, the inventor of the latest serious
&aelig;sthetic system, talks of the "science of art," but he
says<a name="FNanchor_A_345" id="FNanchor_A_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_345" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Science&mdash;true science, is a science of the spirit&mdash;Philosophy.
Natural sciences spoken of apart from philosophy, are complexes
of knowledge, arbitrarily abstracted and fixed.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p class="noin">It is perhaps needless to say that Croce's &aelig;sthetic system,
like all the others, collapses on a breath of inquiry.
On the purely philosophical side of it, further criticism
is unnecessary, and its practical outcome from the point
of view of art is not far removed from the amazing conclusions
of Hegel. From the latter philosopher we learn
that an idol in the form of a stone pillar, or an animal
set up by the primitive races, is higher art than a drama
by Shakespeare, or a portrait by Titian, because it represents
the Idea (Hegel's unintelligible abstraction&mdash;see
Note 5), while Croce tells us that "the art of savages
is not inferior, as art, to that of civilized peoples,
provided it be correlated to the impressions of the
savages." Clearly if this be so, we are not surprised
to learn from Croce that Aristotle "failed to discern the
true nature of the &aelig;sthetic." Nevertheless, whatever
be the outcome of Croce's arguments, his system is at
least more plausible than that of either Hegel or Schopenhauer,
for while these two invent highly improbable
abstractions upon which to base their systems, Croce
only gives new functions to an old and reasonable
abstraction.</p>

<p>The writer does not mean to suggest that these systems
are set up for the purpose of being knocked down:
he desires only to indicate surprise that in new works dealing
with the perception of beauty, it is considered necessary
to restate the old &aelig;sthetic theories and to point out
their drawbacks, albeit the fatal objections to them are
so numerous that there is always fresh ground available
for destructive criticism. The best of the recent works
on the subject that have come under the notice of the
writer, is E. F. Carritt's review of the present position
in respect of &aelig;sthetic systems. Though profound, he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
so comprehensive that he leaves little or nothing of
importance for succeeding critics to say till the next
system is put forward. Yet here is his conclusion<a name="FNanchor_A_346" id="FNanchor_A_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_346" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If any point can be thought to have emerged from the foregoing
considerations, it is this: that in the history of &aelig;sthetics
we may discover a growing pressure of emphasis upon the doctrine
that all beauty is the expression of what may be generally called
emotion, and that all such expression is beautiful.</p></div>

<p class="noin">This is all that an acute investigator can draw from the
sum of the &aelig;sthetic systems advanced. Now what does
this mean? Let us turn to the last page of Carritt's
book and find the object of the search after a satisfactory
&aelig;sthetic system. It is, he says, "the desire to
understand goodness and beauty and their relations with
each other or with knowledge, as well as to practise or
enjoy them." If we accept beauty as the expression of
emotion, how far have we progressed towards the indicated
goal? Not a step, for we have only agreed upon
a new way of stating an obvious condition which applies
to the animal world as well as to human beings. Beyond
this there is nothing&mdash;not a glimpse of sunshine from all the
&aelig;sthetic systems laid down since the time of Baumgarten.</p>

<p>More than twenty years ago Leo Tolstoy pointed out
the unintelligible character of these systems, but no
further light has been thrown upon them. Nevertheless
Tolstoy's own interpretation of the significance of
beauty cannot possibly meet with general approval.
He disputes that art is directly associated with beauty or
pleasure, and finds in fact that what we call the beautiful
representation of nature is not necessarily art, but that<a name="FNanchor_B_347" id="FNanchor_B_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_347" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously,
by means of certain external signs, hands on to others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>feelings he has lived through, and that other people are affected
by these feelings, and also experience them.</p></div>

<p class="noin">This definition may mean almost anything, and particularly
it may imply pure imitation which Tolstoy
condemns as outside of art. But it certainly does not
include many forms of what we call art, the author specially
condemning for instance, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and
declaring that while <i>Faust</i> is beautiful, "it cannot produce
a really artistic impression." The definition then
seems to represent little more than a quibble over terms.
Tolstoy says that the beautiful representation of nature
is not art, but something else is. Very well then, all we
have to do is to find a new term for this representation
of nature, and the position remains as before except
that the meaning of the term "art" has been changed.</p>

<p>The evolutionary principle has been applied to art by
Herbert Spencer and J. A. Symonds, but not in the sense
in which it is used in connection with the development
of living organisms. Spencer traces a progression from
the simple to the complex in the application of the arts,
but not in the arts themselves<a name="FNanchor_A_348" id="FNanchor_A_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_348" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>; and Symonds endeavours
to prove that each separate marked period of art shows
a progression which is common to all; that is, from
immature variations to a high type, then downwards
through a lower form represented by romanticism or
elegance, to realism, and from this to hybrid forms.<a name="FNanchor_B_349" id="FNanchor_B_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_349" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Spencer's argument is suggestive, but his conclusions
have been mostly upset by archaeological discoveries
made since his great book was published. The illustrations
given by Symonds are highly illuminating, but
they are very far from postulating a general law of evolution
operating in the production of art.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to mention Hegel's art periods,
though one can only do so with a feeling of regret that
a man who achieved a high reputation as a philosopher
should have entered the province of art only to misconstrue
its purpose with fantastic propositions which have
no historical or other apparent foundation. He divides
art history into Symbolic, Classic, and Romantic periods
respectively. To accomplish this he invents or discovers
a new abstraction which he calls the Idea, this representing
man's conception, not of God, but of His perfection&mdash;His
supreme qualities, so that in one sense the Idea
may be called the Absolute, in another the Spirit, and
in another, Truth. These terms are in fact interchangeable,
and each may be a manifestation of another, or of
God. This Idea, he says, being perfect beauty, is the
basic concept of art. In archaic times man was unable
to give expression to this concept, so he represented it by
symbols: hence the earliest art was Symbolic art. In
the time of the Greeks man had so advanced that he
was able to give higher expression to the Idea, and he embodied
it in a perfect human form. This is the Classic
period, which Hegel indicates continued till Christianity
spread abroad, when Classic form, though perfect as art,
was found insufficient for the now desired still higher
expression of the Idea. This expression could not be
put into stone, so other arts than sculpture were used for
it, namely, poetry, painting, and music, which are placed
together as Romantic art. This is as nearly as possible
a statement of the periods of Hegel in short compass.
It is impossible to interpret logically his arguments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
nor is it necessary, for his conclusions when tested in the
light of experience, develop into inexplicable paradoxes
and contradictions which border on the ridiculous.
Needless to say, the acceptance of this division means
the annihilation of our ideas of the meaning of art, and
the condemnation to the limbo of forgetfulness of nearly
all the artists whose memory is honoured.</p>

<p>The general interpretation of the terms "Classic Art"
and "Romantic Art" widely differs from that of Hegel,
and varies with the arts. In the literary arts the distinction
is obvious, but the terms are used to define both
periods and classes; in architecture the Gothic period is
usually called the Romantic epoch; and in painting the
terms have reference to manner, the more formal manner
being called Classic, and the soft manner, Romantic;
though it is commonly understood that Romantic art
is especially concerned with subjects associated with the
gentler side of life. But there is no general agreement.
Some writers assert that Giorgione was the first of the
romanticists, others give the palm to Watteau, a third
section to Delacroix, and a fourth to the Barbizon School.
We must await a clear definition of "Romantic Art."</p>

<p>It may be reasonably argued that the want of development
of the plastic arts in England during the literary
revival, was largely due to artificial restrictions. Fine
paintings were ordered out of the churches by Elizabeth,
and many were destroyed; while, following the lead of
the court, there was little or no encouragement offered
by the public to artists except perhaps in portraiture.
Flaxman truly said of the destruction of works of art
in this period, that the check to the national art in England
occurred at a time which offered the most essential
and extraordinary assistance to its progress.</p>

<h4><br /><a name="Enote_7" id="Enote_7"></a><a href="#Eanchor_7">NOTE 7. PAGE 16</a></h4>

<p>During the last half century or so, various writers of
repute, including Ruskin and Dean Farrar, have professed
to find in the poorer works of the Italian painters
of the fourteenth century, and even in paintings of
Margaritone and others of the previous century, evidence
of strong religious emotion on the part of the artists. It
is claimed that their purpose in giving simple solemn
faces to their Madonnas and Saints, was "to tell the
sacred story in all its beauty and simplicity"; that they
possessed a "powerful sincerity of emotion"; that they
"delivered the burning messages of prophecy with the
stammering lips of infancy," and so on. It is proper to
say that there is nothing to support this view of the early
painters. We find no trace of any suggestions of the
kind till the last of these artists had been dead for about
four hundred years, while their lives, so far as we have
any record, lend no warranty to the statements. The
painters of the fourteenth century took their art seriously,
but purely as a craft, and it was not uncommon with
them to combine two or three other crafts with that of
painting. They designed mostly sacred subjects for the
simple reason that the art patrons of the day seldom ordered
anything else. In their private lives they associated
together, were generally agreeable companions,
and not averse to an occasional escapade. Moreover
the time in which they lived was notable for what we
should call loose habits, and indeed from the thirteenth
century to the end of the fifteenth, religious observances
and practices were of a more hollow and formal character
than they have ever been since.</p>

<p>The position occupied by these painters in the progression
of art from the crude Byzantine period upwards,
corresponds with that of the Roman painters of the third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and fourth centuries in the progression downwards to
the Byzantine epoch, and there is no more reason for
supposing that the Italians were actuated by special
emotions in their work, than that the Romans were so
moved. In both cases the character of the work, as
Reynolds put it in referring to the Italians, was the result
of want of knowledge. The countenances usually presented
by both Roman and Italian artists have a half
sad, half resigned expression, because this was the only
kind of expression that could be given by an immature
painter whose ideal was restricted by the necessity of
eliminating elements which might indicate happiness.
Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, Duccio, and a few more, were
exceptions in that their art was infinitely superior to the
average of the century, but all from Giotto downwards,
laboured as craftsmen only. No doubt they often worked
with enthusiasm, and in this way their emotions may
have been brought into play, but there is no possible
means of identifying in a picture the emotions which an
artist may have experienced while he was painting it.</p>

<p>As to the sad expression referred to in these Italian
works, it may be observed that Edgar A. Poe held that
the tone of the highest manifestation of beauty is one
of sadness. "Beauty of whatever kind," he says, "in
its supreme development invariably excites the sensitive
soul to tears."<a name="FNanchor_A_350" id="FNanchor_A_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_350" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> But Poe is clearly mistaken here. It
is not the beauty of the work that affects the emotions to
tears, when they are so affected, but the subject of the
design exhibiting the beauty. A picture or poem representing
a sad subject may be very beautiful, but the
sadness itself would not assist the beauty, though it
might increase the emotional effect. The higher forms
of beauty rarely draw our tears, but elicit our admiration
without direct thought of anything but the beauty.

<p>It is commonly, but wrongfully, supposed that Rembrandt
used his broadest manner in painting commissioned
portraits. The number of his portraits known to
exist is about 450, of which fifty-five are representations
of himself, and fifty-four of members of his household, or
relatives. There are, further, more than seventy studies
of old men and women, and thirty of younger men. The
balance are commissioned portraits or groups. This
last section includes none at all of his palette knife pictures,
and not more than two or three which are executed
with his heaviest brushes. Generally his work broadened
in his later period, but up to the end of his life his more
important works were often painted in a comparatively
fine manner, though the handling was less careful and
close.<a name="FNanchor_A_351" id="FNanchor_A_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_351" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> The broadest style of the artist is rarely exhibited
except in his studies and family portraits. Further
it is extremely unlikely that a palette-knife picture
would have been accepted in Holland during Rembrandt's
time as a serious work in portraiture.</p>

<p>Reynolds evidently had little faith in original genius.
Addressing Royal Academy students, he said<a name="FNanchor_A_353" id="FNanchor_A_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_353" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You must have no dependence on your own genius. If you
have great talents, industry will improve them; if you have but
moderate abilities, industry will supply the deficiency. Nothing
is denied to well-directed labour; nothing is to be obtained without
it.... I will venture to assert that assiduity unabated by
difficulty, and a disposition eagerly directed to the object of its
pursuit, will produce effects similar to those which some call the
result of natural powers.</p></div>

<p class="noin">On another occasion Reynolds observed of Michelangelo<a name="FNanchor_B_354" id="FNanchor_B_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_354" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He appears not to have had the least conception that his art
was to be acquired by any other means than great labour; and
yet he of all men that ever lived, might make the greatest pretensions
to the efficacy of native genius and inspiration.</p></div>

<p>Gibbon said that Reynolds agreed with Dr. Johnson
in denying all original genius, any natural propensity
of the mind to one art or science rather than another.<a name="FNanchor_C_355" id="FNanchor_C_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_355" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Hogarth also agreed with Reynolds, for he describes
genius as "nothing but labour and diligence."</p>

<p>Croce says that genius has a quantitative and not a
qualitative signification, but he offers no demonstration.<a name="FNanchor_D_356" id="FNanchor_D_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_356" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Evidently he is mistaken, for the signification is both
quantitative and qualitative. It is true that what a
Phidias, or a Raphael, or a Beethoven puts together is a
sum of small beauties, any one of which may be equalled
by another man, but he does more than represent a number
of beauties, for he combines these into a beautiful
whole which is superior in quality and cannot be estimated
quantitatively. We may possibly call Darwin a
genius because of the large number of facts he ascertained,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>and the correct inferences he drew from them, but
we particularly apply the term to him by reason of the
general result of all these facts and inferences, this result
being qualitative and not quantitative. Croce probably
took his dictum from Schopenhauer, who, however,
represented degrees of quality as quantitative,<a name="FNanchor_E_357" id="FNanchor_E_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_357" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> which is

<p>It is often observed by advocates of "new" forms of
art that the work of many great artists has been variously
valued at different periods&mdash;that leaders of marked
departures in art now honoured, were frequently more or
less ignored in their own time, while other artists who
acquired a great reputation when living, have been
properly put into the background by succeeding generations.
For the first statement no solid ground can be
shown. In painting, the artists since the Dark Age
who can be said to have led departures of any importance,
are Cimabue, Giotto, the Van Eycks, Masaccio,
Lionardo, D&uuml;rer, Giorgione, Raphael, Michelangelo,
Titian, Holbein, Claude, Rubens, Rembrandt, Velasquez,
Watteau, Reynolds, and Fragonard. All of these had
their high talents recognized and thoroughly appreciated
in their lifetime. In sculpture the experience is
the same, for there is no sculptor now honoured whose
work was not highly valued by his contemporaries. So
with poetry, but before the invention of printing and
in the earlier days of this industry, poetry of any kind
was very slow in finding its way among the people.
What might seem nowadays to have been inappreciation
of certain poets was really want of knowledge of them.</p>

<p>There is more truth in the assertion that many artists
who had a high reputation in their lifetime are now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>more or less disregarded, though it does not follow from
this that there has been a reversal of opinion on the part
of the public, or a variation in the acuteness of &aelig;sthetic
perception. Generally we find that these artists very
properly held the position they occupied in their time and
country, and if they do not now stand on exalted pedestals
it is only because we compare them with men of other
periods and places, which their contemporary countrymen
did not do, at least for the purpose of establishing
their permanent position in art. Carlo Maratta for
instance was celebrated in Italy as the best painter of
his country in his time, and even now we must so regard
him, but his contemporaries as with ourselves did not
place him on so high a level as his great predecessors
of the sixteenth century, and some of the seventeenth.
A special reason why many of the seventeenth century
artists of Italy have fallen in public esteem may be found
in the fact that they excelled mostly in the production
of sensorial beauty, paying little attention to intellectual
grace, and the ripening of general intelligence as time goes
on makes us more and more sensitive to beauty of mind.</p>

<p>There have been many definitions of "Impressionism"
given, but they vary considerably. Professor Clausen
describes it as the work of a number of artists whose
interest is in recording effects of light, seeking to express
nature only and disregarding old conventions.<a name="FNanchor_A_358" id="FNanchor_A_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_358" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Mr.
D. S. MacColl says that an impressionist is<a name="FNanchor_B_359" id="FNanchor_B_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_359" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>a painter who, out of the completed contacts of vision constructs
an image moulded upon his own interest in the thing seen, and not
on that of any imaginary schoolmaster.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p class="noin">This definition is insufficient by itself, but the writer
makes his meaning clearer in the same article when he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Impressionism is the art that surveys the field, and determines
which of the shapes and tones are of chief importance to the
interested eye, and expresses these and sacrifices the rest.</p></div>

<p>According to C. Mauclair, an acknowledged authority
on impressionism, the impressionist holds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Light becomes the one subject of a picture. The interest of the
objects on which it shines is secondary. Painting thus understood
becomes an art of pure optics, a seeking for harmonies, a
species of natural poem, entirely distinct from expression, style,
drawing, which have formed the main endeavour of preceding
painting. It is almost necessary to invent a new word for
this special art, which, while remaining throughout pictural, approaches
music in the same degree as it departs from literature
or psychology.<a name="FNanchor_A_360" id="FNanchor_A_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_360" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p></div>

<p class="noin">What can be said of so amazing a declaration? The
arts of painting and music do not, and cannot, have any
connection with each other. They are concerned with
different senses and different signs, and by no stretch of
the imagination can they be combined. Seeing that
musical terms when used in respect of painting by modern
critics are almost invariably made to apply to colour
harmonies, we may infer that a confusion of thought
arises in the minds of the writers from the similar physical
means by which colour and sound are conveyed to
the senses concerned. But this similarity has nothing
to do with the appreciation of art. The &aelig;sthetic value
of a work is determined when it is conveyed to the mind,
irrespective of the means by which it is so conveyed.</p>

<p>According to La Touche it was Fantin Latour who
invented modern impressionism. Braquemond relates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
that La Touche told him the following story.<a name="FNanchor_A_361" id="FNanchor_A_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_361" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> He (La
Touche) was one day at the Louvre with Manet, when
they saw Latour copying Paolo Veronese's Marriage at
Cana in a novel manner, for instead of blending his
colours in the usual way, he laid them on in small touches
of separate tones. The result was an unexpected brilliancy
("papillotage imprevu") which amazed but
charmed the visitors. Nevertheless when Manet left
the Louvre with La Touche, he appeared anything but
satisfied with what he had seen, and pronounced it humbug.
But Latour's method evidently sunk into his mind,
for a few days later he commenced to use it himself. Thus,
added La Touche, was modern impressionism unchained.
The date of this visit was not given by La Touche, but
1874 was subsequently suggested. This account does not
fit in with the statement of MacColl that when Monet and
Pissarro were in London during the siege of Paris, the study
of Turner's pictures gave them the suggestion of these
broken patches of colour.<a name="FNanchor_B_362" id="FNanchor_B_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_362" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> If this be true Monet must
have antedated Manet in the application of isolated tones.</p>

<p>D. S. Eaton asserts that in the Salon of 1867, there was
exhibited a picture by Monet which was entitled Impressions,<a name="FNanchor_C_363" id="FNanchor_C_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_363" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
and from this arose the word "Impressionist";
but Phythian says that the word resulted
from Monet's "Impression, soleil levant," exhibited in
1874 at the Nadar Gallery in Paris with other works from
Le Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs,
et Graveurs. Phythian adds<a name="FNanchor_D_364" id="FNanchor_D_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_364" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thus, unwittingly led by one of the exhibitors, visitors to the
exhibition came to use the word "impressioniste," and within a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>few days a contemptuously unfavourable notice of the exhibition
appeared in <i>Le Charivari</i> under the heading "Exposition des
Impressionistes." It was not until the lapse of several years that
the name came into general use. The painters to whom it was
applied disowned it because it was used in a depreciatory sense.
Eventually however, unable to find a better one, they adopted it.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Another origin of Impressionism is given by Muther.
He says<a name="FNanchor_A_365" id="FNanchor_A_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_365" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The name "Impressionists" dates from an exhibition in Paris
which was given at Nadar's in 1871. The catalogue contained
a great deal about impressions&mdash;for instance, "Impression de mon
pot au feu," "Impression d'un chat qui se promene." In his criticism
Claretie summed up the impressions, and spoke of the Salon
des Impressionistes.</p></div>

<p>But the real origin of impressionism must be sought
earlier than 1871, for in 1865 Manet exhibited his
Olympia in the Salon des Refus&eacute;s. This picture did
not represent what was understood as impressionism ten
years later, but it led the way towards the establishment
of the innovation, in that it pretended that healthy ideas
and noble designs were secondary considerations in art.
Certainly Manet could not descend lower than this
wretched picture, and in this sense his subsequent work
was a distinct advance.</p>

<p>The reason given by impressionists for the juxtaposition
of pure colours is that the natural blend produced
is more brilliant than the tone from the mixed colours
applied, but it is pointed out by Moreau-Vauthier that
the contrary is the case. He says<a name="FNanchor_B_366" id="FNanchor_B_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_366" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<p>C&eacute;zanne and Van Gogh are not usually put forward
as representative impressionists, but it is impossible to
differentiate logically between the various "isms" of
which impressionism is the mother, and to attempt a
serious argument upon them would be apt to reflect upon
the common sense of the reader. The sincere impressionist
certainly produces a thing of beauty, however
ephemeral and lacking in high character the beauty may
be, but most of the productions of the other "isms"
only serve the purpose of degrading the artist and the
art.</p>

<p>This form of picture is by no means new, though
except among the inventors of sprezzatura, and the modern
impressionists, it has always been executed as a
rough sketch for the purpose of settling harmonies for
serious work. Lomazzo relates that Aurelio, son of
Bernadino Luini, while visiting Titian, asked him how
he managed to make his landscape tones harmonize so
well. For reply the great master showed Aurelio a large
sketch, the character of which could not be distinguished
when it was closely inspected, but on the observer
stepping back, a landscape appeared "as if it had suddenly
been lit up by a ray of the sun."<a name="FNanchor_A_367" id="FNanchor_A_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_367" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> From Luini's
surprise, and inasmuch as we have no record of similar
work before his time, it is reasonable to suppose that
Titian was the first great artist to use this form of sketch
for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>The example of this picture at the Pitti Palace is
specially noted because it seems impossible that the
duplicate in the Uffizi Gallery can be by Raphael, for it
has obvious defects, some of which have many times
been pointed out. The expression is vastly inferior to
that in the Pitti portrait, for instead of a calm, noble,
benign countenance, we have a half-worried senile face
which is anything but pleasant. Raphael was the last
man to execute a portrait of a Pope without generalizing
high character in the features. It will be observed
also that in the Uffizi portrait, the left hand is
stiff and cramped, and the drapery ungracefully flowing,
while both uprights of the chair are actually out of
drawing. There are other examples of the same picture
in different museums, but the Pitti work is far above
these in every respect, and seems the only one which
can be properly attributed to the master. Passavant
affirms that some of the repetitions of the work were
certainly made in the studio of Raphael under his orders,
and thinks that the duplicates passed for originals even
in his time.<a name="FNanchor_A_368" id="FNanchor_A_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_368" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>To the knowledge of the writer, the only logical connection
between the work of Rembrandt and impressionism
that has been suggested, is from the pen of
Professor Baldwin Brown, who remarks<a name="FNanchor_B_369" id="FNanchor_B_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_369" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rembrandt in his later work attended to the pictorial effect
alone, and practically annulled the objects by reducing them to
pure tone and colour. Things are not there at all, but only the
semblance, or effect, or impression of things. Breadth is in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>way combined with the most delicate variety, and a new form of
painting, now called "impressionism" has come into being.</p></div>

<p class="noin">The professor is mistaken here. During the last fifteen
years of his life, apart from portraits, a few studies of
heads, and some colour experiments with carcases of
meat, Rembrandt executed, so far as is known, about
three dozen pictures, and in all of these he effectually
prevents us from forming a general impression of the
designs before considering the more important details,
by concentrating nearly all the available light upon the
countenances of the principal personages represented;
while in the management of the features, the whole purpose
of the chiaroscuro is for the purpose of obtaining
relief. Moreover the pictures are nearly all groups of
personages in set subjects, and there would be no
meaning in the designs if the objects were "practically
annulled," for particular action and expression are necessary
for their comprehension.</p>

<p>As to Velasquez there is no evidence tending to support
the statement that he was an impressionist. The first
authority on the artist has definitely pointed out that
he never took up his brushes except for an important
and definite work: "he neither painted impressions nor
daubs."<a name="FNanchor_A_370" id="FNanchor_A_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_370" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>It will always be a matter of surprise that so much
popularity was secured by the light sketches of the
Barbizon School, considering their general insignificance
from the point of view of art, and the conspicuously
artificial means adopted for their exploitation. Some of
the artists of this school, having accomplished many
studio works of merit, acquired the habit of painting in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>the open air. By this method it is impossible to execute
a comprehensive natural scene, and the painters did not
attempt the task, but they produced numberless sketchy
works of local scenes under particular atmospheric conditions.
They laboured honestly and conscientiously,
and their sketches were put out for what they were and
nothing more. The paintings would probably have retained
their place as simple studies had not some commercial
genius conceived the idea of putting them into
heavy, gorgeous, gilt frames. With this embellishment
they were successfully scattered round the world, mostly
in the newer portions, much to the general astonishment.
The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the frames puzzled many persons,
though it was frequently observed that the pictures do
not look well unless surrounded by ample gold leaf.
Thus, C. J. Holmes, Director of the London National
Gallery, and an authority on impressionism, notes<a name="FNanchor_A_371" id="FNanchor_A_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_371" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Barbizon pictures are almost invariably set in frames with an
undeniably vulgar look. Yet in such a rectangle of gilded contortion
a Corot or a Daubigny shows to perfection: place it in a
frame of more reticent design, and it becomes in a moment flat,
empty, and tame.</p></div>

<p class="noin">The purpose of this frame is obvious. The eye is caught
by the dazzling glitter, and feels immediate relief when
it rests upon the quiet grey tone of the painting, the
pleasurable sensation resulting therefrom being mistaken
for involuntary appreciation of the beauty of the work.</p>

<p>As finished paintings these Barbizon sketches are
novel, but as studies they are not, for similar work has
been executed for two or three centuries, and particularly
by the Dutch artists of the seventeenth century. In
every considerable collection of drawings such sketches
may be found, and there is scarcely a Barbizon painter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>whose work was not anticipated by a Dutch master.
One has only to examine the drawings in the public art
institutions of Europe by De Molyn, Blyhooft, Jan
de Bischop, Lambert Doomer, Berghem, Avercamp, and
others, to find examples which, if executed now, might
easily be taken for works by the Barbizon masters.</p>

<p>In recent times attempts have been made to upset the
dictum of Aristotle as to the imitative character of the
arts generally, exception being taken in respect of music
and architecture. The first objection as to music arose
with Schopenhauer, though he does not appear to have
been quite certain of his position. He stated that while
the other arts represent ideas, music does not, but being
an art it must represent something, and he suggested that
this something is the "Will," the term being used in the
Schopenhauer philosophical sense, that is to say, implying
the active principle of the universe, not being God.
This means nothing at all from the point of view of
art, and cannot even be seriously considered. The most
notable essay on the subject since Schopenhauer is from
the pen of Sidney Colvin who places music and architecture
in a non-imitative group by themselves, the
former on the principal ground that "it is like nothing
else; it is no representation or similitude of anything
whatever"; while architecture, he says, "appeals to our
faculties for taking pleasure in non-imitative combinations
of stationary masses."<a name="FNanchor_A_372" id="FNanchor_A_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_372" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> But what Aristotle
meant is that the arts are imitative in character, and not
that they necessarily attempt to produce works of similitude
with nature, this being evident from the fact that he
pointed out that the higher works of art surpass nature,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>and he divided poetry and painting into three sections,
of which the first is better than life, and the third inferior
to it.</p>

<p>The musician in producing his art proceeds in precisely
the same way as the poet or painter. He takes natural
signs and rearranges them in a new order, producing a
combination which is not to be found complete in nature,
but every sign therein is natural and must necessarily
be so. The higher the flight of the poet, or musician, or
painter, or sculptor, the farther is the result from nature,
but nevertheless the whole aim of the musician, as of
the poet, is to represent emotional effects or natural phenomena
beyond experience in life, as the great sculptor
represents form and expression, and the great poet besides
these things, every abstract quality, passion, and
emotional effect, above this experience; but he cannot
do more; he cannot represent something outside of nature,
and so must imitate, that is, in the sense of representation.</p>

<p>Darwin notes that even a perfect musical scale can be
found in nature. He says<a name="FNanchor_A_373" id="FNanchor_A_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_373" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is a remarkable fact that an ape, a species of the gibbon
family, produces an exact octave of musical sounds, ascending and
descending the scale by half tones. From this fact, and from
the analogy of other animals, I have been led to infer that the
progenitors of man probably uttered musical tones, and that consequently,
when the voice is used under any strong emotion, it
tends to assume, through the principle of association, a musical
character.</p></div>

<p class="noin">It has been further demonstrated that the strength of the
sensory impressions from certain sounds is due to the
structure of the ear, and that generally a particular
kind of sound produces a similar kind of emotional
effect in animals as in man. Obviously the musician
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>is powerless to do more than widen or deepen this
effect. Colvin admits that the musician sometimes
directly imitates, as when he produces the notes of birds
or the sounds of natural forces, or when he represents
particular emotions; but he regards the former instances
as hazardous and exceptional, and indicates that a
particular emotional harmony may affect the hearers
differently. True, but the hazard of the first condition
is the result of the limitations of the artist, and the
second condition is the consequence of the limitations of
the art. The effect of music being purely sensorial must
vary with the emotional conditions surrounding the
hearer. The musician does what he can, but he is unable
to go so far as the poet and produce an emotional effect
which will with certainty be recognized by every person
affected, at all times, as having the same particular
bearing.</p>

<p>Taine separates music ("properly so called" as distinguished
from dramatic music) and architecture from
the imitative arts, as they "combine mathematical
relationships so as to create works that do not correspond
with real objects."<a name="FNanchor_A_374" id="FNanchor_A_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_374" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Obviously the whole purpose of
dramatic music is to imitate the effects of the passions,
but its necessary inclusion amongst the imitative arts
upsets the dictum of Taine, for the emotional effects of
one kind of music only differ from those of another kind
when they differ at all, in the character of the natural
emotional effects represented.</p>

<p>In the case of the architect, seeing that his art is
subordinated to utility, his scheme, his measurements,
and the character of his materials, are largely or almost
entirely governed by conditions outside of his art, and
consequently it is only possible for him to represent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>nature to a limited extent. Rarely can he vaguely suggest
a natural aisle beneath the celestial dome, a rock-walled
cave whose roof soars into obscurity, or a fairy
grotto backed by a beetling cliff. Sometimes he may
cause us to experience similar effects in kind to those
we feel when we recognize grandeur in nature, but
usually he is compelled to confine his beauty to harmonies
produced by symmetrical designs of straight lines
and curves. But in his simplest as in his most complex
designs, he must follow nature as closely as possible.
Purely ornamental forms always appear more beautiful
when the parts have a direct mathematical relationship
with each other than when they have not; that is to say,
when the parts appear to be naturally related. Thus,
that a cross appears to be less agreeable to the sight
when the horizontal bar is below the centre of the perpendicular
than when it is above this point, is due to
what appears to be a want of balance because the form
is unobservable in nature. In trees the horizontal parts
are usually above the middle of the height of the observable
trunk, and in the exceptions nature gives the
whole tree a conical or other shape, the relative position
of the horizontal parts being obscured in the general
form.</p>

<p>As with parts of forms, so with the forms as wholes.
Other things being equal, that design is the best where the
forms are directly proportioned one with the other and
with the whole, and this is because we are accustomed
to the order of design in nature where everything is
balanced by means of direct proportions and corresponding
relations. The architect therefore, like the musician
or poet, must represent nature so far as he can within the
limits of his art, though his representation is comparatively
weak owing to the artificial restrictions imposed
upon him.</p>

<p>The dictum of Aristotle in reference to metre in poetry
related only to epic and dramatic verse, for what we
understand as lyric poetry was separated by the Greeks
as song in which of course metre is compulsory. It is
doubtful whether a single definition can cover both epic
poetry, whose beauty lies almost wholly in the substance,
and lyric verse where the beauty rests chiefly in qualities
of expression and musical form, and in which indeed the
substance may be altogether negligible. A cursory examination
of Watts-Dunton's definition of "Poetry,"
which is admittedly the best put forward in recent times,
shows its entire inadequacy. "Absolute poetry," he
says, "is the concrete and artistic expression of the human
mind in emotional and rhythmical language."<a name="FNanchor_A_375" id="FNanchor_A_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_375" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> This
would exclude from the art some of the finest sacred
verse, which, though in the form of prose, has been
recognized as poetry from time immemorial. Metre is
only one of the devices of the poet for accomplishing his
end&mdash;-the presentation of beautiful pictures upon the
mind, but in high poetry there is a still more compulsory
artifice which is not included in Watts-Dunton's definition,
and that is metaphor. In the form of words the
details of a picture can only be dealt with successively,
and not simultaneously, and without metaphor the
poet would sometimes be in the position of the painter
who should present a dozen different pictures each containing
only one part of a composition, and call upon
the observer to put the pieces together in his mind.
Further the term "absolute" in the definition quoted
has no comprehensible meaning if it does not exclude
a good deal of verse which is commonly recognized
as poetry, while, as is admitted by Watts-Dunton,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>there is much accepted lyric verse without concrete
expression.</p>

<p>In high poetry as in high painting, the beauty appeals
both to the senses and the mind, and in each art the
quality descends as the sensorial overbalances the intellectual
appeal, and the effect becomes more ephemeral.
In the very highest of the plastic arts, colour has
little value except in assisting definition; and in the very
highest poetry musical form has only an emphasizing
value, for the sensorial beauty arising from form in the
one case, and form and action in the other, entirely overpowers
the harmonies of colour and tone respectively.
But colour without design is meaningless, so that it cannot
be applied in the fine arts apart from design: hence in
painting, colour presents no complication in respect of
definition. On the other hand music, with or without
association with poetry, is equally an art since in either
case it imitates the effects of human emotions in a
beautiful way. Thus, where metre is present poetry is a
combined art, and seeing that metre may not be present,
a definition of "Poetry" must cover what may be in one
case a pure, and in another, a compound art.</p>

<p>There seems to be a tendency to overestimate the
disparity between translations of high poetry and the
originals. The value of a translation depends primarily
upon the character of the thing translated, since it is the
form that is unreproducible in another tongue, and not
the substance. In epic and dramatic poetry where the
form is of secondary importance, a good literal translation
may come much nearer to the original than a
translation of a lyric where the form is usually of at least
equal importance with the substance. We lose less of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Homer or Sophocles than of Sappho or Theocritus in
translation. In the case of epic poetry the higher its
character, the closer to the original appears the translation,
because the form is of less relative importance.
More of Dante is lost than of Homer in literal translation,
but the difference narrows when the new versions
are in metrical form, for the use of metre in translation is
necessarily more detrimental as the substance of the
original increases in power, and this relative weakening is
emphasized as the beauty of form in the translation is
raised. Pope is farther from Homer than Chapman, and
Chapman than the prose translations of Buckley and
Lang. As we descend in the scale of the art, so it becomes
more difficult to reproduce the poet in translation,
and in most lyric poetry the beauty seems almost entirely
lost in another tongue from the original, though when
the substance is of weight, and the translator is himself
a good poet, he sometimes gives us a paraphrase with
a high beauty of its own. Some modern poets seem to
eschew substance altogether. Much of the verse of
esteemed French and Belgian poets is quite meaningless
in literal translation, the authors relying for the effects
entirely upon musical form and beauty of expression.</p>

<p>Lessing points out this remarkable picture of Homer
as emphasizing the beauty of Helen, observing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What could produce a more vivid idea of beauty than making
old age confess that it is well worth while the war which cost so
much blood, and so much treasure?</p></div>

<p class="noin">Nevertheless the remark of the old men does not seem to
mean so much as the description of the sages and their
reference to the goddesses. It is difficult to imagine
several wise men agreeing that the sanguinary war of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
nine years was really excusable in view of Helen's beauty,
and the statement therefore is naturally received as a
permissible overcolour. Consequently the effect of the
remark would be discounted, and unlikely to be sufficient
for the purpose of the poet. True, the Greeks seem to
have been childlike sometimes in their simplicity, but
there is no evidence that they were so wanting in a sense
of proportion as to accept literally this opinion of the
elders. But when we observe the senility of the elders,
and the physical feebleness which has apparently rendered
them incapable of sensual pleasures, then indeed
we must marvel at a beauty which excites their emotions
so powerfully as to bring the goddesses to their
minds.<a name="FNanchor_A_376" id="FNanchor_A_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_376" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>In discussing the suitableness of this incident as a subject
for a painting, Lessing remarks that the passion
felt by the old men was "a momentary spark which their
wisdom at once extinguished," but later on, referring to
the possibility that the veil worn by Helen when she
passed through the streets of Troy had not been removed
when she was seen by the elders, he points out<a name="FNanchor_B_377" id="FNanchor_B_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_377" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When the elders displayed their admiration for her, it must
not be forgotten that they were not seeing her for the first time.
Their confession therefore did not necessarily arise from the present
momentary view of her, for they had doubtless often experienced
before the feelings which they now for the first time acknowledged.</p></div>

<p class="noin">This is very true, but it only serves to deepen the impression
of Helen's beauty, for the element of surprise is removed
from the minds of the elders, the mere sight of
her, veiled or unveiled, being sufficient to recall the passionate
thrills previously experienced.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_376" id="Footnote_A_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_376"><span class="label">[a]</span></a> See on this subject Quintilian, viii., 4.</p></div>

<p>In nearly all the instances of sublimity quoted by
Longinus there is this particular merit of brevity&mdash;-the
picture is thrown upon the brain immediately, without
pause or anything whatever to complicate the beauty.
But the learned critic directs attention only to the
magnificent thoughts and the appropriate use of them,
without pointing out the extraordinary condensation of
the language employed. Apart from the instance from
Genesis given, there is another of his examples in which
practically the whole beauty of the picture is produced
by the rapidity of its presentation. This is the exclamation
of Hyperides when accused of passing an illegal
decree for the liberation of slaves&mdash;"It was not an orator
that made this decree, but the battle of Ch&aelig;ronea."
Longinus observes<a name="FNanchor_A_378" id="FNanchor_A_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_378" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the same time that he exhibits proof of his legal proceedings,
he intermixes an image of the battle, and by that stroke of art
quite passes the bounds of mere persuasion.</p></div>

<p class="noin">But it was rather the manner in which the battle was
introduced than the fact of its introduction, that gave
force to the argument. If instead of confining himself to
a short brilliant observation, Hyperides had carefully
traced cause and effect in the matter, he would still
have intermixed an image of the battle, but he would
not then have produced a work of art.</p>

<p>Still finer instances of the use of brevity in expresssion
by the orator are to be found in the speeches of Demosthenes.
For example in his oration On the Crown he
says: "Man is not born to his parents only, but to his
country." A whole volume on the meaning and virtue
of patriotism could not say more: hence the sublime art.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>The simple statement lights a torch by which we examine
every convulsion in history; presents a moving picture
in which we see the motives and aspirations guiding the
patriots of a hundred generations; sets an eternal seal
of nobility upon the love of man for his native country.
And a few words suffice. The same thought might be
elaborated into a large volume, but the art would fly with
the brevity.</p>

<p>There are many translations of the Ode to Anactoria,
but the best of them reflects only slightly the depth of
passion in the original. The version which most nearly
represents the substance, while maintaining the unhalting
flow of language, is perhaps that of Ambrose Philips
(1675-1749), which runs thus:&mdash;-</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
Blest as th' immortal gods is he,<br />
The youth who fondly sits by thee,<br />
And hears, and sees thee all the while<br />
Softly speak, and sweetly smile.<br />
<br />
'Twas this deprived my soul of rest,<br />
And raised such tumults in my breast;<br />
For while I gazed, in transport tost,<br />
My breath was gone, my voice was lost.<br />
<br />
My bosom glowed; the subtle flame<br />
Ran quick through all my vital frame;<br />
O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung;<br />
My ears with hollow murmurs rung.<br />
<br />
In dewy damps my limbs were chilled;<br />
My blood with gentle horrors thrilled;<br />
My feeble pulse forgot to play;<br />
I fainted, sunk, and died away.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The English reproductions of this ode in the Sapphic
measure are not very successful, the difficulty of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
being due to the practical impossibility of fulfilling the
quantitative conditions of the strophe without stilting
the flow of language, or unduly varying the substance.
But it has been shown by Dr. Marion Miller in his translation
of Sappho's Hymn to Aphrodite, which is much
higher in substance and somewhat less condensed in expression
than the Ode to Anactoria, that with certain liberties
in respect of quantities, a very beautiful semblance
of the Sapphic measure may be produced in English.
His translation of this hymn is unquestionably the best
in our language, though this is perhaps partly due to the
fact that he is almost the only translator who has adhered
to the text in regard to the sex of the loved person. To
make the object of affection a man seems inappropriate
to the language employed in the verse. (It is proper to
mention that a license taken by Dr. Miller in his translation&mdash;-where
he renders the passage relating to the
sparrows, as "clouding with their pinions, Earth's wide
dominions"&mdash;suggested to the present writer the somewhat
similar picture to be found on Page 111.)</p>

<p>The gradual decadence of the great period of Grecian
sculpture is well marked by the successive variations of
the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles. The copy of this
at the Vatican is no doubt a close representation of the
original, but later there was commenced a long series of
variations, all of them more or less complicating the design.
First a pillar was substituted for the vase, reaching
nearly to the armpits, and the left forearm rested
upon it, while drapery fell down the front, so that some
exertion was required to separate the figure to the eye.
Then a dolphin was substituted for the pillar, the head of
the animal resting on the ground, and the body rising up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>straight with the bent tail forming the support. Then
for this was placed a dolphin with its body corkscrew
shaped, which was particularly weak as it tended to
deprive the figure of repose. After this, while the dolphin
was maintained, a cestus was sometimes added, and
heavy drapery applied in various folds. Finally the
attitude of the figure was changed, that of the Venus de'
Medici being adopted, while the pillar or dolphin was
retained. Each alteration necessarily diminished the
beauty of the figure.</p>

<p>Reynolds seems to have been disappointed with the
frescoes of Raphael when he first saw them, and this
fact has been called in evidence by some modern critics
to support their contention that the art of the great
masters is really inferior to that wherein design is subordinated
to colour. But Reynolds very definitely admitted
that his first impression was wrong, for after
studying the frescoes, he notes<a name="FNanchor_A_379" id="FNanchor_A_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_379" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In a short time a new taste and a new perception began to
dawn upon me, and I was convinced that I had originally formed
a false opinion of the perfection of art, and that this great painter
was well entitled to the high rank which he holds in the admiration
of the world.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Reynolds was quite a young man when he went to Rome,
and his appreciation of Raphael increased as his experience
matured. More than twenty years after the visit,
he remarked that Raphael had "a greater combination of
the high qualities of the art than any other man,"<a name="FNanchor_B_380" id="FNanchor_B_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_380" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> and
ten years later he affirmed that the Urbino artist stood
foremost among the first painters.<a name="FNanchor_C_381" id="FNanchor_C_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_381" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Reynolds supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>that his lack of appreciation of the frescoes when he first
saw them arose from want of immediate comprehension
of them: he was unaccustomed to works of such great
power, but it is to be observed that his inspection was a
very short one, and we may reasonably draw the conclusion
that changing light conditions had much to do with
the effect the paintings left upon him at the time. When
one enters a room where the light differs materially in
intensity or quality from that experienced just previously,
it is advisable to rest quietly for a little while before
examining works defined by colour, in order that the
eyes may become accustomed to the new light.</p>

<p>That the judgment of the public upon a work of art is
final seems to have been recognized by all the ancient
writers who dealt with the matter, and that the Greeks
generally held this view is evident from many incidents,
notably the reference to public judgment in the great
competition between Phidias and Alcamenes. During
the Renaissance also the opinion held good, and it is
worth noting that the suggestion sometimes made that
Michelangelo did not conform to this view is unsupported
by evidence. Vasari relates the following anecdote<a name="FNanchor_A_382" id="FNanchor_A_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_382" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He [Michelangelo] went to see a work of sculpture which was
about to be sent out because it was finished, and the sculptor was
taking much trouble to arrange the lights from the windows to the
end that it might show up well; whereupon Michelangelo said to
him: "Do not trouble yourself, the important thing will be the light
of the piazza"; meaning to infer that when works are in public
places, the people must judge whether they are good or bad.</p></div>

<p>Lionardo went so far as to advise artists to hear any
man's opinion on his work, "for," he said, "we know
very well that though a man may not be a painter, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>has a true conception of the form of another man."<a name="FNanchor_A_383" id="FNanchor_A_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_383" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
It is a common misconception with the general public,
though not among serious artists, that by reason of their
profession artists are better judges of works of art than
other men. Obviously the recognition of beauty in art
is apart altogether from the means by which it is created,
and subject to the exceptions noted elsewhere, all men
are alike able to appreciate high beauty. Winckelmann
even advised his readers against the judgment of artists
on the ground that they generally preferred what is
difficult to what is beautiful,<a name="FNanchor_B_384" id="FNanchor_B_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_384" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> but experience with the
great art bodies in Europe who hold exhibitions does not
support this view. It is only the weaker artists who are
liable to be prejudiced in such matters, and when the
judges are of high attainments in art, they almost
invariably make the same choice in competitions that
would be made if general opinion were solicited. But
although artists cannot be better judges of high-class
works of art (as beautiful things) than other men of equal
intelligence, their training usually enables them to
distinguish obscure forms of beauty which would be
unrecognized by the general public, and in matters of
colour to differentiate between ephemeral and more or
less permanent harmonies. Hence while the public
interests would not suffer from the introduction of
the lay element in judging high class sculpture and
painting, it is obvious that the consideration of works
where the lower forms of beauty only are produced,
as in formal decoration, should be confined to the
profession.</p>

<p>In music alone of the arts, for reasons already given,
special cultivation is necessary for the judgment of the
higher forms of beauty.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that the vast multitude of
men and women&mdash;the toilers in the fields and factories,
and their families, do not appreciate great works of art;
that rarely they take an interest in any kind of art, and
then only in simple representations of everyday incidents.
This is so apparently, but it is not strictly true.
The great bulk of working people grow up amidst surroundings
where they do not have an opportunity of
seeing good works of art. They toil from morn to eve
during their whole life: their imaginations are almost
entirely confined to their means of livelihood, their
daily routine of labour, and their household duties. A
"mute inglorious Milton" remains mute because he
wants the knowledge and experience around which his
fancy may roam, and a potential Raphael dies in obscurity
from the enforced rigidity of his imagination.
But even so, notwithstanding that the nervous activities
and the imaginations of the poorer workers remain undeveloped,
they are still subservient to the irrevocable
laws of nature. Their faculties may be little changed
from childhood in respect of matters appertaining to the
higher senses, but they still exist. So it comes about that
in all times since art has been practised, the paintings
and sculptures of the greater masters have been well
appreciated by the multitude when they could come
into contact with them. In modern times great works
of art are seldom available to the masses except in public
galleries where their sense perception and minds are
quickly confused and fatigued&mdash;in fact rendered incapable
of legitimate use, but the trend of popular opinion
is very decidedly settled by the experience of those
business houses which undertake the reproduction of important
works. There are many times the demand for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
prints and cards of pictures belonging to the higher forms
of art, as for instance, sacred and historical subjects, and
portraits, than for interiors and landscapes, and so
incessant is this demand for the better works, that a
painter desiring to copy one of the great Raphael or
Correggio Madonnas at Florence for reproduction, will
usually have to wait three or four years after entering
his name, before his turn comes to set up his easel. It
is rather the want of intelligent contact with them, than
indifference to them, that is due the apparent lack of
interest in great works of art on the part of the labouring
classes.</p>

<p>There is a deal of truth in the incisive remarks of Leo
Tolstoy when dealing with this question. He says <a name="FNanchor_A_385" id="FNanchor_A_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_385" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Art cannot be incomprehensible to the great masses only because
it is very good, as artists of our day are fond of telling us.
Rather we are bound to conclude that this art is unintelligible
because it is very bad art, or even is not art at all. So that the
favourite argument (na&iuml;vely accepted by the cultured crowd),
that in order to feel art one has first to understand it (which really
means to habituate oneself to it), is the truest indication that
what we are asked to understand by such a method, is either very
bad art, exclusive art, or is not art at all.</p></div>

<p class="noin">One may observe however that, as a rule, it is only inferior
artists who complain of the want of public appreciation
of great works of art.</p>

<p>According to Lessing and Watts-Dunton, what the
former calls the dazzling antithesis of Simonides&mdash;"Poetry
is speaking painting, and painting dumb poetry"&mdash;has
had a wide and deleterious effect upon art criticism.
Lessing, who wrote <i>Laocoon</i> about 1761, said in his preface
in reference to this saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was one of those ideas held by Simonides, the truth of which
is so obvious that one feels compelled to overlook the indistinctness
and falsehood which accompany it.... But of late many
critics, just as though no difference existed, have drawn the crudest
conclusions one can imagine from this harmony of painting and
poetry.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Watts-Dunton, writing a few years ago, added to this<a name="FNanchor_A_386" id="FNanchor_A_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_386" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It [the saying of Simonides] appears to have had upon modern
criticism as much influence since the publication of Lessing's
<i>Laocoon</i> as it had before.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Lessing points out that the Greeks confined the saying
to the effect produced by the two arts, and (evidently
referring to Aristotle) did not forget to inculcate that
these arts differed from each other in the things imitated
and the manner of imitation.</p>

<p>Since the business of both poetry and painting is to
throw pictures on the mind, the declaration of Simonides
must be accepted, but it has no particular meaning as
applied either to criticism or the practice of the arts. It
is merely a fact of common knowledge put into the form
of a misleading <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, though one has a natural
reluctance in so describing a time-honoured saying.
There is room for doubt whether it really had the effect
upon criticism that is alleged. Annibale Carracci varied
it slightly into a better form with "Poets paint with
words, and painters speak with the pencil," and it was
certainly as well known in his time as in the eighteenth
century, yet we find no particular evidence of weak art
criticism either in the sixteenth or seventeenth century.
Moreover allegorical painting was not less common in
these centuries than in the century following; and while
there was unquestionably a spurt of descriptive poetry
in the eighteenth, it is difficult to trace a connection between

<p>A few distinguished poets have attempted to portray
beauty of form by description of features, but they have
all been signally unsuccessful. The best known essay
of the kind is Ariosto's portrait of Araminta, where he
closely describes all details of her features and form, using
forty lines for the purpose; but put together the pieces
as one will, it is quite impossible to gain from them an
idea of the beauty of her countenance.<a name="FNanchor_A_387" id="FNanchor_A_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_387" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> This is pointed
out by Lessing. The very length of the catalogue is
apt to kill the beauty as one endeavours to dovetail the
separate elements. Perhaps the lines of Cornelius Gallus
to Lydia form the most perfect poetical delineation of a
beautiful face known to us, but as will be seen from the
translation below, they are quite insufficient to enable us
to picture the beauty of the combined features on our
minds.<a name="FNanchor_B_388" id="FNanchor_B_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_388" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>If there be one example of descriptive poetry relating
to landscape which throws upon the mind a complete
natural scene during the process of reading, it is the
beautiful chant of the Chorus in <i>&#338;dipus Coloneus</i>.
The perfection of form and majestic diction of this poetry
are remarkable, but the successful presentation of the
picture on the mind is largely due to the simple and direct
language used, and the astonishing brevity with which
the many features of the scene are described. Green
dells, fields, plains, groves, rocks, flowers, fruit, and rushing
waters, are all brought in, and the few lines used do not
prevent the introduction of the Muses, the jovial Bacchus
with the nursing nymphs, and radiant Aphrodite. All
modern poetry descriptive of landscape entirely fails in
presenting a comprehensive view. It is too discursive&mdash;over
descriptive, to permit of the mind collecting the
details together as one whole. Here is the best prose
version of the lines of Sophocles<a name="FNanchor_A_389" id="FNanchor_A_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_389" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thou hast come, O stranger, to the seats of this land, renowned
for the steed; to seats the fairest on earth, the chalky Colonus;
where the vocal nightingale, chief abounding, trills her plaintive
note in the green dells, tenanting the dark-hued ivy, and the
leafy grove of the god, untrodden, teeming with fruits, impervious
to the sun, and unshaken by the winds of every storm; where
Bacchus the reveller ever roams attending his divine nurses.
And ever day by day the narcissus, with its beauteous clusters,
bursts into bloom by heaven's dew, the ancient coronet of the
mighty goddesses, and the saffron with golden ray; nor do the
sleepless founts of Cephisus that wander through the fields fail,
but every day it rushes o'er the plains with its limpid wave,
fertilizing the bosom of the earth; nor have the choirs of the
Muses loathed this clime; nor Aphrodite too, of the golden reign.</p></div>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to remind some readers that
the term "invention" is used in two senses in art, referring
to the original idea or scheme, or to the preparation
of the design embodying the idea. In poetry and fiction
the term has the former significance; in painting and
sculpture the latter. The restriction in the use of the
term in the last named arts is compulsory. (See Chap.
III., and Note 33.)</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br /><a name="Enote_33" id="Enote_33"></a><a href="#Eanchor_33">NOTE 33. PAGE 81</a></h4>

<p>Apparently Lessing did not observe that inasmuch as
the painter cannot present the beginning and end of an
incident, he must necessarily take his moment of action
from the literary arts or from nature. The critic notices
that the painter does not invent the action he depicts,
but states that this is due to his indifference towards
invention, developed by the natural readiness of the
public to dispense with the merit of invention in his
case. That is to say, the public expects the painter to
take his idea from the poet or from nature, and looks to
him only for correct design and execution: hence the
painter is under no necessity to invent his own scheme.</p>

<p>It is curious that a reason of this kind for the practice
of the painter should be put forward by so keen a critic
as Lessing, but it is not altogether surprising when we
remember the discussion as to whether Virgil drew his
representation of the Laocoon incident from the celebrated
sculptured group, or the sculptors adopted the
device of the poet. Lessing definitely settled the point
in favour of the poet as the author of the design, and since
his time this decision has been confirmed over and over
again by practical evidence. But the conclusion of
Lessing seems obvious in the absence of any such evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>dence.
As we must exclude the possibility of both poet
and sculptors taking the design from the same original
source, it is clear that the poet could only have imitated
the sculptors on the supposition that they had so widely
varied the legend as to necessitate a new beginning and
end of the story, these being provided by the poet.
Consideration of such a series of events is not permissible,
as it would reflect upon the common sense of the sculptors,
and actually degrade the poet.</p>

<p>Consequent upon the inability of the painter to originate
a scheme for a picture, the famous proposition of
Lessing as to the relative importance of invention and
execution with the poet and painter, must fall to the
ground. The critic states that our admiration of Homer
would be less if we knew that he took certain of his work
from pictures, and asks<a name="FNanchor_A_390" id="FNanchor_A_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_390" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How does it happen that we withdraw none of our esteem from
the painter when he does no more than express the words of the
poem in forms and colours?</p></div>

<p class="noin">He suggests as an answer to this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With the painter, execution appears to be more difficult than
invention: with the poet on the other hand the case seems to be
reversed, and his execution seems to be an easier achievement
than the invention.</p></div>

<p class="noin">The word "invention" is to be taken here in the sense of
plot or fable, and not as the details of design invented
by the painter for the purpose of representing the action
described by the poet. The premisses of Lessing's argument
therefore will not stand, for the painter cannot
originate a fable by means of a picture. And sequential
to this of course, the painter can be of no service to the
poet. Homer could not draw an original scheme from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>a painting. Nor may the poet take a detail from the
painter, for this has already been borrowed. A poet may
vary a detail in a legend because he can make the successive
parts of his relation fit in with the variation, but
the painter can only deal with a single moment of action,
and if this does not correspond with an accepted legend,
then his design appears to be untrue.</p>

<p>It may be said in regard to painting, that the relative
difficulty of the invention (the work of gathering and
arranging the signs) and the execution, varies with the
character of the art. In the higher forms, as sacred and
historical work, the invention is the more difficult; in
ordinary scenes of life and labour the trouble involved
in invention would about equal that in execution; while
in the lower forms, as landscape and still-life, the execution
is obviously the more difficult. In the case of the
poet, the idea or fable is the hardest part of his work,
but the relative difficulty of the arrangement of the
parts, and the execution, would naturally depend upon
the general character of the composition, and the form
of the poem.</p>

<p>The works here referred to are those designed for the
purpose of achieving a political or social aim, or conveying
instruction or moral lessons. There are many
examples of good art where advocacy of a social or administrative
reform is presented by way of incident or
accessory, though the art itself is never, and cannot be,
assisted thereby. "Didactic Art," if such a term may
be appropriately used, is practically a thing of the past,
but judging from certain conventions the opinion seems
to be rather widely held that art should point a moral
when possible, and an opinion of Aristotle is not infre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>quently
called in to support this view. But when Aristotle
connected morals with art, he evidently did not
mean to suggest that art should have a moral purpose,
but that it should have a moral tendency in not being
morally harmful, for art which is not morally harmful
must necessarily be morally beneficial. The general
connection of the good with the beautiful in ancient
Greece seems to have merely implied that what is good
is beautiful, and what is beautiful is good, or should be
good, and not that goodness is a manifestation of beauty,
or beauty of goodness. It was admitted that the two
things may not coincide.</p>

<p>That landscape painting may be of considerable value
in assisting scientific exploration is instanced by an
anecdote related to the writer by a geological friend.
Professor Jack, formerly Government Geologist of
Queensland, while travelling in that colony, having put
up one night at the house of a small squatter, noticed on
the walls of the interior, a number of colour drawings
which had been painted by a son of the settler from views
in the neighbouring hills. One of these drawings showed
a reddish-brown tint running down the slope of a grey
and nearly barren hill. This caught the eye of the professor
who asked the artist if the colours roughly represented
the natural conditions, and receiving an affirmative
reply, recommended the squatter to prospect the ground
for minerals. This was done with the result that
profitable copper deposits were found. It seems that
in Australia many of the best mineral veins are capped
with iron, and run through schistose rocks traversed by
dioritic dykes. Professor Jack was well aware that the
hills in the district were formed of these rocks and dykes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and as the reddish-brown streak indicated iron oxide,
it occurred to him that the iron might be the cap of a
lode holding valuable minerals.<a name="FNanchor_A_391" id="FNanchor_A_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_391" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>Remarkable evidence of the universality of ideals, is
afforded by the galaxy of French sculptors who appeared
in the thirteenth century. They could have had no
teachers beyond those responsible for the stiff and formal
works characterizing the merging of Norman with Gothic
art; they could have seen few of the fragments of ancient
sculpture; and yet they left behind them monuments
which rival in noble beauty much of the work produced
in the greatest art period. How their art grew, and how
it withered; how such a brilliant bloom in the life of a
nation should so quickly fade, needs too detailed an
argument to be ventured upon here, if indeed a properly
reasoned explanation can be given at all; but the flower
remains, as great a pride to mankind as it is a glory to
France: remains, though sadly drooping, for the petals
of Rheims are gone.</p>

<p>Now these Frenchmen were in much the same position
as the early Greeks. They were confronted with the
task of making images of their objects of worship for
great temples. They had no more real knowledge of the
Personality of Christ, the Virgin, and most of the Saints
than had the Greeks of the Homeric gods and legendary
heroes, and like the Grecian sculptors they fully believed
in the spiritual personages and religious events with
which they dealt. The Grecian and French artists
therefore started from the same line with similar general
ideals, for the ancient workers took no heed of Homer
and Hesiod in respect of the failings of their gods; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>they both had only pure formalities in sculpture behind
them. And what was the result? The ideal divine head
of the Christian Frenchman is much the same as that
of the Greeks in regard to form, and only varies in expression
with the character of the respective religious
conceptions.</p>

<p>The French sculptors did not reach the sublime height
of the Phidian school, nor did they attempt the more
human beauty typified by the giants of the fourth
century <small>B.C.</small>; but apart from these, and leaving aside considerations
of the nude with which they were little concerned,
they climbed to the highest level of the latter end
of the fourth century and the beginning of the third&mdash;the
level attained by those Grecian sculptors who more or
less idealized portrait heads by adding Phidian traits.
And it would appear that in reaching towards their goal
they followed the same line of thought as the Greeks, and
arrived at similar conclusions in respect to every detail
of the head and pose of the figure. As a rule they gave
to the faces of Christ and the Saints a large facial angle,
set the eyes in deeply and the ears close to the head,
and generally worked on parallel lines with the principal
sculptors of Peloponesia living sixteen hundred years
before their time. It is perhaps natural that they should
make similar variations in the proportions of the figures
to provide for the different levels from which they were
to be seen, but it is curious that they should adopt the
practice followed by the Greeks in the representation of
children in arms, by minimizing to the last degree the
figure of the Infant Christ in the arms of the Madonna.
They could not have more closely imitated the Greeks
in this respect had they had Grecian models in front of
them. No doubt they fixed the position of the Child at
the side of the Virgin in order that the line of her majestic
form might not be broken, and that her face might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
be revealed to observers below the level of the statues,
but that they should have made the Child so extremely
small and insignificant considering His relative importance
compared with that of the Grecian infant in arms,
is remarkable.</p>

<p>It is too early yet to fix definitely the position of Rodin
in art. There is much sifting of his works to be done,
for of all artists with a wide reputation, he was perhaps
the most variable. Still he may be called one of the
greater artists, and so is amongst the rare exceptions
mentioned, for he executed one or two hideous figures,
the most notable being La Vieille Heaulmi&egrave;re.<a name="FNanchor_A_392" id="FNanchor_A_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_392" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> This
cannot properly be described as a work of art because it
is revolting to the senses: it is merely a species of writing&mdash;a
hieroglyph, and Rodin's own apology for it is a direct
condemnation, since a work of sculpture cannot be good
if general opinion does not approve of it. He says<a name="FNanchor_B_393" id="FNanchor_B_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_393" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What matters solely to me is the opinion of people of taste, and
I have been delighted to gain their approbation for my La Vieille
Heaulmi&egrave;re. I am like the Roman singer who replied to the jeers
of the populace, <i>Equitibus Cano</i>. I sing only for the nobles;
that is to say for the connoisseurs. The vulgar readily imagine
that what they consider ugly is not a fit subject for the artist.
They would like to forbid us to represent what displeases and
offends them in nature. It is a great error on their part. What
is commonly called "ugliness" in nature can in art become full
of great beauty. In the domain of art we call ugly what is deformed,
whatever is unhealthy.... Ugly also is the soul of
the vicious or criminal man.... But let a great artist or
writer make use of one or other of these uglinesses, instantly it
becomes transfigured: with a touch of his fairy wand he has turned
it into beauty: it is alchemy: it is enchantment.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p class="noin">Rodin then goes on to refer to the description of ugly
objects by the poets, in support of his argument that they
may be represented by the painter! It was his error in
confusing the objects of the literary with those of the
plastic arts, that led him to carve La Vieille Heaulmi&egrave;re,
for he admitted that he wished to put into sculpture
what Villon had put into a poem. Professor Waldstein
properly pointed out that, this being so, the observer of
the sculpture should be provided with a copy of the poem
when in front of the statue, adding<a name="FNanchor_A_394" id="FNanchor_A_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_394" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">and even then the work remains only the presentation of a female
figure deformed in every detail by the wear and tear of time, and
of a life ending in disease and nothing more. It is the worst form
of literary sculpture, of which we have had so much by artists who
represent the very opposite pole of the modern realists.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Elsewhere the respective positions of the poet and painter
(or sculptor) in the representation of ugliness are dealt
with, but it may be added that in the case of La Vieille
Heaulmi&egrave;re, Rodin does not render in sculpture the poem
of Villion, but only a part of it, for of course he could not
show the progression in the life of the courtesan, indicated
by the poet, which progression puts an entirely different
complexion upon the ugly figure of the poet compared
with that of the sculptor. Clearly Rodin was misled when
he said that people of taste have given their approbation
to his appalling figure, for it has been condemned among
all classes, while its few defenders have failed to support
their opinions by reason or experience.</p>

<p>We may note that at another time Rodin reflected
upon the character of the ancient Greek sculpture for
the very reason upon which he bases his claim for public
approval of La Vieille Heaulmi&egrave;re. He says<a name="FNanchor_B_395" id="FNanchor_B_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_395" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>:</p>

<p class="noin">Here also is a confusion of ideas, for the intelligence cannot
dream of a special kind of beauty which would not
be recognized by the humble, unless it were so feeble as
to be altogether below Greek conceptions. The aim of
the Greek sculptors was to appeal to all classes, and in
this they were eminently successful.</p>

<p>In the case of the Madonna, Michelangelo does not
appear to produce an ideal woman: he only gives an
improved woman. His nearest approach to the ideal is in
his early Pieta at St. Peter's, but even here the Virgin is
only a less earthly prototype of his later figures. The
Madonna in the Holy Family at the Uffizi is much inferior,
being merely a slightly ennobled Italian peasant.
The other Madonnas are far higher in character and seem
to suggest the antique, except that the more material
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>qualities of woman are always present. The Madonnas
at the Bargello and San Lorenzo are of the same general
type as the figure in the Last Judgment, the Night in the
Medici Chapel, the Leda in the Bargello, and the Venus
in the sketch made for Pontormo. This being so, it
may be imagined when the Leda is called to mind, that
it is hard to associate the two Madonnas with Christian
ideals. The figures are magnificent works, but they are
behind the Madonnas of Raphael from the point of view
of Christian conceptions. The expression is general, and
all the countenances except one, indicate unconcern with
surroundings; not the sublime unconcern of a Phidian
god, which implies an apparent disregard of particulars
because they are necessarily understood with an all-powerful
comprehension of principles, but an unconcern
which suggests a want of deep interest in life. The
exception is the San Lorenzo Madonna, in which a certain
calm resignation is the principal feature in expression.
Michelangelo was more successful with his men than
with his women. His painted prophets in the Sistine
Chapel are as sublime as his scenes from the Creation;
and his Moses in St. Peter's is rightly regarded as the
first sculpture of the Renaissance.</p>

was first exposed, some comment was made upon the
comparatively youthful appearance of the Virgin, and
Condivi relates that he spoke to the sculptor on the
subject. In reply Michelangelo said<a name="FNanchor_A_398" id="FNanchor_A_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_398" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Don't you know that chaste women preserve their beauty and
youthful character much longer than those who are not chaste?
How youthful then must appear the immaculate Virgin who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>cannot be supposed ever to have had a vitiated thought. And
this is only according to the natural order of things: but why
may not we suppose in this particular case, that nature might be
assisted by Divine interposition, to demonstrate to the world the
virginity and perpetual purity of the Mother? This was not
necessary in the Son, nay, rather on the contrary, since Divine
omnipotence was willing to show that the Son of God would take
upon Him, as he did, the body of man, with all his earthly infirmities
except that of sin. Therefore it was not necessary for me to
make the human subordinate to the Divine character, but to consider
it in the ordinary course of nature under the actual existing
circumstances. Hence you ought not to wonder that from such a
consideration, I should make the most holy Virgin-Mother of
God, in comparison with the Son, much younger than would otherwise
be required, and that I should have represented the Son at
His proper age.</p></div>

<p>A few modern painters have produced works in which
the Holy Family are pictured in lowly surroundings,
but generally they appear to shock the public sense of
propriety. Many persons will remember the sensation
caused by Millais's The Carpenter's Shop, where Christ
is shown as a boy of about ten years of age in the workshop
of St. Joseph, and Holman Hunt's Shadow of the
Cross. Later artists have been still more realistic,
notably Uhde, whose sacred scenes almost stagger one
with their modern suggestions, and Demont-Breton,
whose Divine Apprentice represents the Boy Christ
sharpening a tool at a grindstone which is turned by the
Virgin.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the rapid advance in Italian art in the
fifteenth century was largely due to the influence of the
ancient Greek and Roman remains. Indeed there are
very few sculptors of the period who fail to show evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>dence
of studies in Greek forms and ornaments, while in
painting there are hundreds of figures which could scarcely
have been designed in the absence of antique models.
True in some cases the artists do not appear to have
gone beyond the ancient literature, as with Masaccio
who must have had Homer in his mind when he painted
his figures of Eve in the Florence frescoes, and Piero di
Cosimo, whose fanciful compositions savour of the old
legends wrapped up in fairy stories; but many painters
were steeped both in the art and literature of Greece and
Rome, and made good use of them.</p>

<p>But the most direct evidence of the influence of Greek
art upon Italian artists of the fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries, is to be found in the splendid series of bronze
statuettes of the period. In their monumental figures
the sculptors were more or less confined in their designs
by considerations of portraiture, conventional drapery
and symbols, and local requirements, and while they were
greatly assisted by Greek experience, yet only rarely
were they strictly at liberty except with ornaments and
accessories. But in the small bronze figures their fancy
could roam at will, and they made good use of this freedom
in displaying their ready acceptance of the first
principle in the design of the human figure recognized
by the Greeks&mdash;that the sculptor must arrive at perfection
of form if that be possible; that this perfection is not
to be found in any single form in life, and consequently
the artist must combine perfected parts into a harmonious
whole, independently of particular models. The
agreement with this principle was general, with scarcely
an exception amongst the bronze figure designers, and
the result was that in the period say, from 1450 to 1525,
there was executed a series of bronzes fully representative
of the highest level which plastic art has reached
since the greater days of Greece. Right up to the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of the maturity of Michelangelo, nearly every bronze
figurine cast is purely Grecian in type, and every ornament,
and even every accessory which is not from its
nature of contemporary style, can be traced to Greece,
either directly or through Rome.</p>

<p>Michelangelo brought about a change in accentuating
the muscular development of the body, and before the
middle of the sixteenth century most sculptors had come
under his influence. This was unfortunate for he alone
seemed to be capable of harmoniously combining Greek
lines with muscular power. A few of his contemporaries,
as Sansovino, Leone, Cellini, learned how to join, with
due restraint, his innovations with modifications of the
Greek torso, but generally the imitation of the great
Florentine initiated a decadence, as it was bound to do,
for it was accompanied with life modelling, and so meant
a radical departure from the Greek forms. Giovanni di
Bologna alone among the later sixteenth century sculptors,
was strong enough to move in an independent direction.
He restrained the accentuation of the muscles,
and lightened the Greek type of torso, combining with
these conditions an elegance in design which has never
since been surpassed.</p>

<p>This then is the principal cause of the high &aelig;sthetic
value of the Renaissance bronzes: the human form exhibited
by them is altogether more beautiful than the
form coming within the compass of life experience.
Then the details of work on the bronzes are immensely
superior to those of the general modern handiwork.
For instance the chiselling of such men as Riccio and
Cellini, has never been equalled since their time, save
perhaps by Gouthi&egrave;re. And how poor, comparatively,
are the present-day castings! How carefully the old
masters worked; how particular they were with their
clay; how skilfully they prepared their wax, and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
slowly and deliberately the mould! How many artists
now would have the patience to make such a mould?
For the beautiful patinas on many of the Renaissance
bronzes, age is mostly responsible, though lacquers were
often used for the provision of artificial patinas, particularly
after the middle of the sixteenth century, the
finest being found on some of the works of Giovanni di
Bologna. The tone of natural patina depends largely
upon the kind of oxidation to which the bronze has been
subjected, and it is no doubt often affected by the alloy
used. Few modern artists have given close attention to
the alloys, while the method of casting is now usually
regarded as a detail of minor importance.</p>

<p>Seeing that the production of figurines accompanied
every civilization from the dawn of history to the collapse
of the Roman Empire, it is curious that the renaissance
of sculpture after the Dark Age should have progressed
a long way before general attention was again turned to
these bronzes. There are a few figures of animals which
seem to be Italian work of the late trecento, but beyond
these the small cast bronzes made in Italy before
the maturity of Ghiberti, were practically confined to
Madonnas and Saints, mostly gilt, made to fill Gothic
niches, or adorn the altars of churches and private chapels.
Slender Saints they were as a rule, but always
elegant, with serene countenances and delicate features;
beautifully modelled as became the inheritors of the
traditions of the Pisanos. It was somewhere about the
middle of the fifteenth century that Italy commenced
to make ungilt statuettes suitable for household ornaments,
and fully ten or fifteen years more passed away
before they were produced with any regularity. The
earliest of them of any importance appear to be a couple
of Flagellators from the design of Ghiberti. They are
fine pieces of work, evidently from clay models made for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the scourging scene in one of the gates of the Florence
Baptistry&mdash;gates described by Michelangelo as worthy
to fill the portals of Paradise. These figures date about
1440. There is a Child Christ of a few years later by
Luca della Robbia; and two or three figures from models
of Donatello may be assigned to the neighbourhood of
1450. In the next ten years were turned out some
figures from remaining models of Donatello which had
been used for his work at Prato and Padua.</p>

<p>So far the small bronzes made were from studies for
larger works of sculpture, but about this time intense
interest began to be taken in the remains of Greek and
Roman art, and no doubt it was the increased importance
attached to the antique bronze figures, mostly household
gods of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, that first
led the principal Renaissance artists to turn their attention
to similar work. From this time on, for a century
and a half, these bronze figures were regularly made.
The existing figurines may be broadly classified in four
divisions, namely, the Paduan and Florentine figures
executed prior to 1525; those of the school of Michelangelo;
those of the Venetian school headed by Sansovino;
and those of Giovanni di Bologna and his school. Leaving
out of consideration the small ornaments for inkstands,
vases, etc., the little animals, and the purely
commercial imitations, chiefly Venetian, made at the
end of the sixteenth century, the total number of Renaissance
bronzes now known is roughly six thousand. Of
these under a hundred are from models for larger works
by Ghiberti, Donatello, Verrocchio, Lionardo, Michelangelo,
and a few lesser lights; about two thousand represent
original designs specially prepared for bronze
production; some three thousand five hundred are duplicates
of, or slight variations from, these originals, executed
by pupils or near contemporaries of the masters;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and the balance of four hundred or so, are direct reproductions
of, or variations from, antique sculptures.
Naturally all collectors aim for the first two sections,
but the third section contains many fine bronzes, often
close to the originals, with equally good patinas. They
vary greatly, though they are all ascribed in commerce
to the artists responsible for the originals.</p>

<p>The character of these variations is best seen in the
case of Riccio, the most prolific of the bronze workers
of the Renaissance. He designed and executed under
forty small bronze figures and groups, besides some large
bronze works of high importance. Of his small pieces
there are in existence about a hundred duplicates made
by his pupils and immediate contemporaries, who also
adapted into household ornaments, various details
from his larger works, bringing up the number of Riccios
made from his models during his lifetime, other than by
himself, to about a hundred and fifty. These are all
bronzes of a high order. Then about an equal number
of both kinds of models were reproduced during the
twenty years following his death, all fairly good, but often
slightly varied from the originals; and finally there are
Riccios copied by Venetian craftsmen in the third quarter
of the sixteenth century, sometimes considerably varied,
and occasionally with purely Venetian ornaments added.
These last mark the first distinct decadence in the small
bronze art of the period. Next to Riccio among the
earlier sculptors, in the number of bronzes designed, was
his great contemporary, Antico, who accomplished some
thirty or so. He differed from Riccio in that while the
latter adhered to the Grecian practice in the design of
details and ornaments, but varied the modelling somewhat
to bring it more in conformity with the contemporary
ideas of elegance, Antico kept strictly to the
Grecian modelling, but commonly varied the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
designs. There are few duplicates of Antico's work,
made either during his lifetime or after. As with Riccio,
his imitators overcame the difficulty of the chiselling by
leaving it out, relying upon the wax to give close enough
resemblance to the originals.</p>

<p>Of the other small bronze sculptors prior to the maturity
of Michelangelo, few executed more than half a
score of figures. The best known are the immediate successors
of Donatello in the Paduan school, as Bertoldo
and Bellano, and the giants of the Florentine school, as
Filarete and A. Pollaiuolo. Bronzes by these artists
are very rare, and so are the duplicates of them made
by pupils, though Bertoldo, who reminds one strangely
of Lysippus, had occasional imitators for the next two
centuries. These bronzes include many models which
have not been equalled by the greatest of later sculptors,
and they will never be matched until there arises a new
school of sculptors resolved to imbibe the truths which the
Renaissance artists gleaned from the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>The writer has used Greek and Roman names for these
gods to some extent indiscriminately, in accordance with
the universal custom in art. Nevertheless the practice
is to be regretted as it tends to complicate the general
ideas of the Greek and Roman religions. Notwithstanding
the occasional direct association of some of
their deities with human personages by their poets, the
Romans regarded their gods as purely spiritual beings,
having no special earthly habitation, or sex relations
with the human race, while their powers widely differed
from those of the respective Greek deities with whom
they are commonly identified. Authorities differ as to
whether the gods were supposed to have spiritual marital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
relations with each other.<a name="FNanchor_A_399" id="FNanchor_A_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_399" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> In any case the whole
nature of their religion precluded the development
amongst the Romans of a separate sacred art. Their
sculptured gods, which were taken from Grecian models,
were symbols rather than presumed types.</p>

<p>If we may judge from the headless figures of the
goddesses, commonly known as the Three Fates, from the
east pediment of the Parthenon, there seems to be little
difference between the general lines of the feminine torso
represented by the Phidian ideal, and those of the
Praxitelean model. The Parthenon torsos are more
massive proportionately, but the object of both Phidias
and Praxiteles was evidently to straighten the outer
lines of the torso as nearly as possible, making due allowance
for the varied natural swellings of their respective
forms. It is obvious that the use of attire gave Phidias
(presuming the Parthenon figures referred to were designed
by him, as they probably were) a latitude in varying the
proportions of the torsos which he could not have exercised
in the case of nude forms. Unclothed, the figures
would appear unwieldy, and the graceful flowing lines
resulting from the partly clinging drapery could not be
so completely presented with nude reclining or semi-reclining
figures. There are other features also which
prevent the nude representation of such massive forms.
Thus, the breasts would necessarily be out of proportion
in size, and widely separated. These conditions are
common in fifth century and archaic figures, and do not
appear to be defects in forms of life size or less, but they
would be strikingly noticeable in super figures of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>broad massive type with Phidian lines. The addition
of light drapery, however, converts the apparent faults
into virtues, for the artist is enabled therewith to give
new sweeping curves to the forms which conspicuously
enhance the general beauty of the figure.</p>

<p>A still more amazing instance where the use of drapery
allows the artist to vary the recognized proportions of the
feminine form to an extent which would be impossible
with nude figures, is the celebrated Ariadne at the
Vatican.<a name="FNanchor_A_400" id="FNanchor_A_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_400" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> This beautiful work, which is of the Hellenistic
period, shows the daughter of Minos attired in a light
flowing single garment, and reclining on a couch, asleep.
The upper part of her body leans against the head of the
couch, but the remainder is extended nearly at full
length. The extraordinary feature of the work is that
the length of the figure is altogether out of proportion
with the head and with the breadth of the torso, being
much too great, and yet so skilfully is the drapery
arranged that this very defect becomes an advantage,
for it enables a lofty grace, almost approaching grandeur,
to be given to the figure, which would be impossible without
the exaggeration. By the excellent device of a
closely arranged cross fold of drapery passing round the
middle of the figure, the artist apparently shortens it,
so that the eye of the observer is not held by its great
length. Only one other example of the supreme use of
drapery in this way seems to be known&mdash;a bronze sitting
figure of Calliope,<a name="FNanchor_B_401" id="FNanchor_B_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_401" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> which is of the late Hellenistic period,
and is obviously of the same school as the Ariadne marble.</p>

<p>Praxiteles is known to have executed at least four
other statues of Aphrodite besides the Cnidian example,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>but this last is the only one as to which we have fairly
complete records, and of which copies have been closely
identified. It is also the most celebrated. We may

<p>There has been much discussion as to whether Apelles
showed the same extent of figure as is represented in the
sculpture, a common suggestion being that he brought
the surface of the water to the waist line; but it is evident
that the painting corresponded with the sculpture in this
particular. The artist had to represent the goddess
walking towards the shore. If he brought the water to
the waist line he could not definitely suggest movement,
as a deflection of the shoulder line might mean that the
goddess was in an attitude of rest, corresponding to the
pose of nearly all the sculptured figures of the Praxitelean
school. On the other hand if he carried the water line
down towards the knees, the advance of the right leg
would be most marked, and the effect disturbing because
of the loss of repose, a quality at all times valuable in a
painting of a single figure, and really necessary in the
representation of Venus. The artist very properly reduced
the portion of the thighs visible to the smallest
fraction possible compatible with an expression of movement,
in order to give the figure the greatest repose
attainable. Under any circumstances there was nothing
to gain by showing the water reaching to the waist.</p>

<p>Certain details of the picture by Apelles are to be
obtained from Grecian epigrams. Thus, one by Antipater
of Sidon contains these lines<a name="FNanchor_A_402" id="FNanchor_A_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_402" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
Venus, emerging from her parent sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Apelles' graphic skill does here portray:</span><br />
She wrings her hair, while round the bright drops flee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And presses from her locks the foamy spray.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p class="noin">From this it would appear that the position of the goddess
when painted was presumed to be comparatively
near the artist, otherwise the separate drops of falling
water would not have been observed. The last line in
the following epigram by Leonides of Tarentum indicates
the ideal character of the countenance, though evidence
of this is scarcely necessary<a name="FNanchor_A_403" id="FNanchor_A_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_403" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
As Venus from her mother's bosom rose<br />
(Her beauty with the murmuring sea-foam glows),<br />

<p>So far as the writer knows, Piero was the only artist
of the Renaissance who used this mythological story for
a composition (his picture has hitherto been called an
allegory), a circumstance which is rather singular considering
the suitableness of the subject for the provision
of effective designs. The Greek sculptors in dealing
with the legend confined themselves to the moment when
Athena threw down the pipes, apparently for the reason
that this instant gave an opportunity of rendering Marsyas
in a strong dramatic action. The famous statue
of the faun after Myron in Rome, is supposed to have
formed part of a group representing Athena and Marsyas
immediately after the pipes were dropped, and the
design appears on still existing coins and vases of the
fifth and fourth centuries <small>B.C.</small> Piero takes a later moment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>showing Marsyas comfortably squatting in the foreground
of a delightful fanciful landscape, expressing
boyish satisfaction with the prizes he is about to try.
He is properly shown as a satyr instead of in the faun
form of the sculptor. There appears to be no legitimate
place in painting for a faun, while a satyr may at times
be appropriately introduced into a pastoral composition.</p>

<p>Controversy has raged around this picture for something
like seventy years. The work came to light before
1850 at a public auction sale when it was attributed to
Mantegna, with whom of course it had nothing to do.
Then it was pronounced a Raphael, but this was disputed
by Passavant who held that on account of the thin lower
limbs of the figures, and the minute way in which the
landscape was painted, it could not be by Raphael, but
was of the school of Francia, or by Timoteo della Viti.
Morelli brought back the attribution to Raphael, and
the work then came into the possession of the Louvre.
Subsequently Pinturicchio and Perugino were alternately
suggested as the painter, and to the latter the
picture was assigned by the Louvre authorities. All
are agreed that the date of the work is about 1502. It
does not seem possible that Perugino could have painted
the picture, for the subject and invention are entirely
foreign to him, while the lithe active form of Apollo does
not consort with the least formal of his known figures.
The landscape is much in his manner, but so it is also
in the style of Raphael's early period, while the small
buildings therein are closely finished as in some of
Raphael's other works of the time.<a name="FNanchor_A_404" id="FNanchor_A_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_404" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Perugino used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>similar towers and buildings, but being a more experienced
painter he did not so finely elaborate the details.
The suggestion relating to the school of Francia was
afterwards very properly withdrawn, and Pinturicchio
must be ruled out on account of the landscape, apart
from the supple figure of Apollo of which he was incapable.
There remain then only Timoteo della Viti and
Raphael as the possible painters of the work. But it
cannot reasonably be suggested that Timoteo could have
accomplished so perfect a figure as the Apollo, and moreover
so original a figure. It certainly required an exceptionally
bold mind to overcome the difficulty in
rendering the traditionally semi-feminine form of Apollo
by representing him as a young man just past his teens.
Besides, the general delicacy of the work is not in the
style of Timoteo. Passavant's objection to the limbs is
overruled by the presence of similar limbs in the Mond
Crucifixion. It would seem then that Morelli was right
in assigning the beautiful little picture to the youthful
period of the greatest of all painters.</p>

<p>The white races are here referred to merely by way of
example, and there is no intention to suggest that the
more or less uncivilized peoples have no perception of
beauty. It is well known that both semi-civilized and
savage races differ from the whites in the matter of
beauty, and the fact has been partly responsible for
several theories for explaining &aelig;sthetic perception, notably
that of association, laid down by Alison and Jeffrey,
but long since discarded. Seeing that there is no difference
in kind between the sense nerves of the whites and
the blacks, they must necessarily act in the same way.
That the blacks appreciate as beautiful forms which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
whites disregard, seems to arise partly from want of
experience, partly from training, and partly from neglect
in the exercise of the sense nerves. Take for example an
inhabitant of Morocco where corpulency is commonly
regarded as an element of beauty in women. If none but
Moroccan women are seen or pictured, it is impossible
for a higher form of beauty than is to be found amongst
them to be conceived, for the imagination cannot act
beyond experience. In cases where the Moroccan has
had experience of both white and black, it is certain
that, other things being equal, the white woman would
be the more admired, for this is the general experience
among the black races, and is strikingly noticeable in
America with the descendants of African tribes. The
appreciation of very fat women can easily be understood
on the ground of custom or training. A youthful
Moroccan may be firmly of opinion that corpulency is
not an element of beauty, but seeing that his older acquaintances
hold a contrary view, he may well form the
conclusion that his judgment is wrong, and so accept
the decision of his more mature countrymen. It is
quite common among the whites for people to doubt
their own &aelig;sthetic perceptions when an inferior work of
art is put forward as a thing of beauty. The general
want of appreciation of certain musical harmonies on
the part of uncivilized peoples is undoubtedly due to the
neglect of the sense nerves concerned, for these are not
cultivated except to a small extent involuntarily. The
most ignorant and poor of the whites unavoidably come
into frequent contact with the simpler forms of art,
but the savage races see only the result of their own
handiwork. The uncivilized races can scarcely be expected
to admire the higher reaches of art wherein intellectual
considerations enter, except for their sensorial
excellence.</p>

<p>There seems to be some uncertainty as to whether
Fragonard intended his splendid series of the Frick
collection to represent the subjects usually assigned to
them, namely, The Pursuit (or The Flight of Design, a
title given to the original sketch for the picture); The
Rendezvous (or The Surprise, or The Escalade); Souvenirs
(or Confidences, or The Reader); The Lover Crowned
(or Before the Painter); and The Abandonment (or
The Reverie). It is suggested that the works have an
allegorical signification connected with art, and certainly
three of them&mdash;the first, second, and fourth&mdash;could be so
interpreted. But magnificent paintings of this kind are
usually fitted for many allegorical suggestions. Each
picture represents an incident of common experience,
elaborated with beautiful figures in a perfect setting.
This approaches the summit of the painter's art, for no
conception can be greater apart from spiritual ideals.
It is symbolism in its highest form&mdash;of universal experience
in which all are interested. The works are not to
be taken as a necessary sequence (the last of the series
was painted twenty years after the others), but the
scheme of one or more of them has come within the
experience of every man and woman since the world
began.</p>

<p>Seeing that this precise dignified pose, coming so near
the line of exaggeration, but never crossing it, is present
in all the authenticated portraits of Titian, save those of
very aged persons, we may reasonably consider the pose
an important factor in determining the validity of certain
portraits as to which a doubt has arisen. Thus in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
case of the Physician of Parma<a name="FNanchor_A_405" id="FNanchor_A_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_405" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> (this title is admittedly
wrong), which has been variously given to Titian and
Giorgione, the verdict must be in favour of Titian, for
the pose is certainly his, while it is unknown in any work
of Giorgione. On the other hand, the portrait of Catherine
Cornara,<a name="FNanchor_B_406" id="FNanchor_B_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_406" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> commonly ascribed to Titian, but also
attributed to Giorgione,<a name="FNanchor_C_407" id="FNanchor_C_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_407" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> cannot be by the former master;
nor is the Portrait of a Man (with his hand on a bust),<a name="FNanchor_D_408" id="FNanchor_D_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_408" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
which seems to pair with the Cornara portrait. The
portrait known as An Old Man Asleep,<a name="FNanchor_E_409" id="FNanchor_E_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_409" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> sometimes given
to Titian, clearly does not belong to him.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the general confusion observable
for many years in the estimation of Giorgione's
work arose from the attribution to him of paintings executed
in the comparatively broad manner of Titian,
but which this artist did not adopt till Giorgione had
been dead for a decade or more. The recent exhaustive
critique of Lionelli Venturi<a name="FNanchor_F_410" id="FNanchor_F_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_410" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> of the earlier master has
cleared the air, and we now know the range of his work
very positively. Giorgione was less fine in some of his
paintings than in others, for he paid more attention to
chiaroscuro as he matured, but there is no instance where
he painted in the broader manner occasionally exhibited
by Titian. All the works in the style of The Concert
and The Three Ages are now known to be by other hands
than those of Giorgione, and it must be unfortunately
admitted that not a single painting by him exists either
in England or America.</p>

<p>Hals is another artist as to whom many misconceptions
have arisen in regard to his use of a very broad manner in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>his portraits. There is a total of about 350 works attributed
to him, of which some two thirds are single portraits,
and twenty are portrait groups. The balance
includes over thirty genre pictures, mostly with single
figures, and fifty heads of boys and girls generally shown
in the act of laughing. It is in his genre work that
the broad manner is mostly observable, and only very
occasionally is it to be found in his portraits. In the
more important works of the artist, even during his
later period, his manner is by no means broad,<a name="FNanchor_A_411" id="FNanchor_A_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_411" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> though
it is not so fine as in his best years, say from 1635 to 1650.
This estimate can however only be general, as his dated
paintings of different periods after 1630 often correspond
so closely that it is difficult to assign dates to the other
pictures with certainty.</p>

<p>Perhaps the frequent attribution to Hals of works by
his pupils and imitators, has had something to do with
the public estimation of the breadth of his manner. This
was often greatly exaggerated by his followers, and
many portraits are given to him which he could not
possibly have painted. In his important work on the
artist, Dr. von Bode points out that some of the duplicates
of his pictures were apparently executed by his
pupils, but these are not separated in the book.<a name="FNanchor_B_412" id="FNanchor_B_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_412" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> It is a
simple matter to divide the works painted by Hals from
the studio copies and the portraits of imitators. His
brushwork and impasto were quite exceptional. He
had a firm direct stroke, never niggled or scumbled, and
his loading was restrained though very effective. Quite
naturally his pupils, however industrious and skilled,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>could not closely imitate his remarkable freedom in
handling. They were incapable of firm decisive strokes
throughout a portrait, and endeavoured to overcome
the loading difficulty by using brushes of a coarseness
foreign to the master when rendering light tones. Moreover
Hals was nearly perfect in drawing, and in this there
are usually marked defects in the studio copies.</p>

<p>The term "grace" as applied in art has so many significations
that it is difficult to deal with one of them without
confusion. What is here specially referred to is the
grace of pose designed by the artist. The object of the
portrait painter is to pose his sitter so that the grace
indicated shall appear natural and habitual, a feature
as important now in the appearance of women as it was
twenty-five centuries ago when Sappho asked<a name="FNanchor_A_413" id="FNanchor_A_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_413" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
What country maiden charms thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">However fair her face,</span><br />
Who knows not how to gather<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her dress with artless grace?</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>But the grace of pose never appears to be artless, after
the first inspection, unless there is something in the
expression to hold the mind. Without this appeal to the
mind the portrait must soon tire, and the pose become
artificial and stiff, that is to say, in representations of
life size, for in miniature portraiture the countenance
seldom or never crosses the vision involuntarily.</p>

<p>In the ancient Greek forms, Winckelmann distinguishes
four kinds of grace&mdash;lofty, pleasing, humble,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>and comic&mdash;but the grace exhibited by sculptured
forms necessarily depends upon the harmony of expression,
character of form, and pose. This should be the
case with painted portraits also, but drapery restrictions
and accessories commonly compel a limitation in the
design of the artist. In three quarter and full length
portraits it is impossible to depart from the dress customary
at the period of execution, unless the sitter assume
a classical character, and this is only possible in comparatively
few instances. In any case the pose should
always be subordinated to the expression.</p>

<p>The remarkable range of Raphael in expression has
been commented upon by many critics, and practically
all agree with Lanzi in his eloquent summary<a name="FNanchor_A_414" id="FNanchor_A_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_414" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is not a movement of the soul, there is not a character
of passion known to the ancients and capable of being expressed
in art, that he (Raphael) has not caught, expressed, and varied in a
thousand different ways, and always within the bounds of propriety....
His figures are passions personified; and love, hope,
fear, desire, anger, placability, humility, and pride, assume their
places by turns as the subject changes; and while the spectator
regards the countenances, the air, and the gestures of the figures,
he forgets that they are the work of art, and is surprised to find
his own feelings excited, and himself an actor in the scene before
him.</p></div>

<p>This Pompeian fresco is supposed to be a copy of the
picture of Timanthes, but there is an ancient marble
relief of the same subject at Florence, the design of which
is also said to have been taken from the Grecian painter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>though it differs considerably from the fresco. Quintilian
observes as to the work of Timanthes, that having
rendered Calchas sad, Ulysses still more sad, and Menelaus
with the deepest expression of grief possible in art,
the painter could not properly portray the countenance
of Agamemnon, who as father of Iphigenia was presumed
to be the most deeply affected of all present, and so
covered his head, leaving the intensity of his suffering
to be understood.<a name="FNanchor_A_415" id="FNanchor_A_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_415" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>The authenticity of the Boston example of Mona
Lisa is still in dispute. So far no serious objection to it
has been brought forward, and there are certain points
in its favour, as the presence of the columns which are
reproduced in Raphael's sketch, and the bold brushwork
of the drapery where this can be distinguished. But
there is another example of the work in existence, and
this fact, with the natural hesitation in pronouncing
definitely on so important a matter, will probably leave
the authenticity of the picture undecided for a long time.
Meanwhile the literature upon Mona Lisa is ever increasing,
and some important facts have been recently
brought out. Amongst these is an announcement by
A. C. Coppier that the lady was not a Florentine, but a
Neapolitan of the Gheradini family, and that she was
married in 1495, when eighteen years of age.<a name="FNanchor_B_416" id="FNanchor_B_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_416" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> She would
therefore be twenty-seven years old in 1504 when the
picture which Raphael sketched is supposed to have been
painted. But the Mona Lisa in the Louvre was completed
between 1515 and 1519; hence there is much to
ascertain as to the history of the work.</p>

<p>The various suggestions that have been made as to
the meaning of Mona Lisa's smile, seem to have no other
foundation than the fancies of mystic minds. The smile
has been called dangerous, sinister, ambiguous, provocative,
purposely enigmatic, significant of a loose woman,
expressive of sublime motherhood, reminiscent of Eastern
intrigue, and so on, the mildest criticism of this kind
affirming that the smile will ever remain an enigma. It
is of course impossible for any meaning to be put into a
smile by the painter, other than that of pleasure. Psychological
suggestions are possible with the poet or
novelist, but not with the painter. If there be any
enigma or mystery in a picture, then the art is bad, for
the work is incomprehensible, but there is no problem
to be solved in Mona Lisa's smile. It is not different
from any other smile except in degree, and of course in
the quality appertaining to the particular countenance.
Lionardo, with his scientific turn of mind, was not likely
to attempt the impossible by trying to mix psychology
with paint.</p>

<h4><br /><a name="Enote_58" id="Enote_58"></a><a href="#Eanchor_58">NOTE 58. PAGE 178</a></h4>

<p>It is necessary to dissent from the conclusion of Lessing
as to the representation of ugliness by the poet. He says
in referring to Homer's portrayal of Thersites<a name="FNanchor_A_417" id="FNanchor_A_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_417" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why in the case of ugliness did he adopt a method from which
he so judiciously refrained in that of beauty? Does not a successive
enumeration of its compound parts diminish the effect of
ugliness, just as a similar enumeration of its parts destroys that of
beauty? Undoubtedly it does, but in this very fact lies Homer's
justification. For the very reason that ugliness in the poet's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
description is reduced to a less repulsive appearance of bodily imperfection,
and in point of its effect ceases as it were to be ugliness,
the poet is enabled to make use of it.</p></div>

<p class="noin">It is true that as he cannot present a particular form of
beauty by description, so the poet cannot describe an
ugly countenance in such a way that it may be pictured
on the mind as a whole; but on the other hand, as he can,
by reference to its effect, or by imagery, present a greater
beauty than the painter can portray, so he may by similar
means suggest a more hideous form of ugliness. And
apart from this, while a detail in the description of a
beautiful countenance is immaterial until it is combined
with other details, a detail of ugliness may in itself be
sufficient to render the countenance wholly repulsive to
the reader. Thus, if one said of a maid that her cheeks
were a compound of the lily and the rose, this would not
necessarily imply that she was generally beautiful; but
if it were said of a man that he had a large bulbous nose,
we should consider him ugly whatever the character of
his other features. It was only necessary for Milton to
refer to one or two details of the figure of Sin, to throw
upon our minds a form of appalling ugliness.<a name="FNanchor_A_418" id="FNanchor_A_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_418" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>A successive enumeration of its component parts, does
not therefore diminish the effect of ugliness, as Lessing
claims, but increases it. On the other hand a successive
enumeration of the parts of beauty does not destroy the
beauty, but simply fails to represent it.</p>

<p>The poet may use ugliness where the painter cannot,
because his ugly form does not dominate the scene, save
for an instant or two, being quickly subordinated by
surrounding conditions of speech and action; whereas
the ugly figure of the painter is fixed for ever. Further,
the poet may surround his description of the ugly thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>with beautiful imagery and lofty sentiment, practically
hiding the ugliness with a cloak of beauty; but the
painter can only depict the ugly thing as it is, naked to
the sight, without gloss or apology.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the foot of Hercules in this
fine bronze was placed upon the skull of an ox to indicate
a successful hunt,<a name="FNanchor_A_419" id="FNanchor_A_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_419" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> but Hercules was a demigod, and so
could not be connected in art with any but a superhuman
task or exploit. Moreover the only instance recorded
in mythological history where Hercules fought with an
ox (unless the feat of strength against the white bull of
Augeas be called a fight), is that of the Cretan bull, which
was captured and not killed. There is no other sculptured
figure now known where a foot is placed on the
skull of an ox, but Pausanias records that he saw one
in a temple of Apollo at Patr&aelig;, the figure being that of
the god himself.<a name="FNanchor_B_420" id="FNanchor_B_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_420" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Pausanias attributes the motive of
the design to Apollo's love of cattle. There is no doubt
about the significance of the Frick bronze. The skull of
an ox, and rams' heads are frequently found on ancient
tombs, and acanthus leaves were commonly used both in
Greece and Rome as funereal signs, while the base of the
statuette, which is cast with the figure, is clearly intended
to represent an altar. It is noticeable that the form of
acanthus leaf used is Roman, suggesting that Pollaiuolo
had access to the reproductions of tomb inscriptions made
to the order of Lorenzo de' Medici.</p>

<p>There is apparently no other existing design of a hero
contemplating death, but Lysippus carved several figures,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>now lost, of Hercules in a sad or depressed mood.
In the most celebrated of these, the demigod was seated
in a thoughtful attitude on a lion's skin, and it is possible
that this design was connected with the contemplation
of death, because it was produced in relief soon after the
time of Lysippus, and later in a Pompeian fresco, in both
cases in the presence of Lichas, the bearer of the poisoned
garment.</p>

level in the art of the painter<a name="FNanchor_A_421" id="FNanchor_A_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_421" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> need scarcely be referred

<p>The authority of Alexander Humboldt has been sometimes
quoted in support of the assertion that landscape
can appeal to the higher attributes, the passage relied
upon affirming that descriptive poetry and landscape
painting "are alike capable in a greater or lesser degree of
combining the visible and invisible in our contemplation
of nature." But it is clear from the whole references of
the writer to these arts, that he means nothing more by
his statement than that a painting or descriptive poem
may, like an actual landscape, induce a feeling of wonder
at the powers of the original Cause of nature. The opinion
of Humboldt upon the position of landscape painting
may be gathered from his definite observation that it
has "a more material origin and a more earthly limitation
than the art which deals with the human form."<a name="FNanchor_B_422" id="FNanchor_B_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_422" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether an artist can invent a form of
tree which does not exist in nature, without producing
something of the character of a monstrosity. From the
point of view of dimensions, the two extreme forms of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>trees used in painting, are represented in Raphael's
Madonna with the Goldfinch<a name="FNanchor_A_423" id="FNanchor_A_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_423" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> as to the slender forms, and
as to the giant trunks, in two or three of Claude's pictures.
The very beautiful trees of Raphael have been
often regarded as pure inventions, and Ruskin was actually
surprised that the artist did not delineate the "true
form of the trees and the true thickness of the boughs";<a name="FNanchor_B_424" id="FNanchor_B_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_424" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
but as a matter of fact precisely similar trees (a variety
of ash) are to be found in the valleys of the Apennines
to this day. All the change that Raphael made was to
transport the trees from a sheltered spot to an open
position. Very similar trees are introduced in the same
master's Apollo and Marsyas.<a name="FNanchor_C_425" id="FNanchor_C_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_425" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Perugino was the first

made them of great height,<a name="FNanchor_D_426" id="FNanchor_D_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_426" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> but he gradually modified
the form till he approached the perfect symmetry and
delicacy of Raphael's examples.<a name="FNanchor_E_427" id="FNanchor_E_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_427" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> Marco Basaiti introduced
them into at least three of his pictures, and they

Francia.<a name="FNanchor_F_428" id="FNanchor_F_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_428" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> Higher and equally slender trees have been

<p>In noting the fact that the great landscape artist
invents his designs, Byron observes that nature does not
furnish him with the scenes that he requires, and adds<a name="FNanchor_I_431" id="FNanchor_I_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_431" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nature is not lavish of her beauties; they are widely scattered,
and occasionally displayed, to be selected with care, and gathered
with difficulty.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Had Byron been a painter, he would have known that the
trouble of the artist is due to the over, and not the under,
supply of beauty by nature. The artist sees the beauty,
but cannot identify it with particular signs, and so has to
invent a scene himself, using nature only for sketches or
ideas.</p>

<p>Although those of the fifteenth-century artists who
treated landscape seriously did not thoroughly understand
perspective, yet they were seldom at a loss in representing
distance, that is, in the clear atmosphere which
they invariably used. They were diffident in attempting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>distance with unbroken level country, and till quite the
end of the century there is no instance where middle and
far distance are shown together, even with the assistance
of hilly ground. The almost invariable practice of the
leading painters who made landscape a feature in their
works, was to introduce water leading back from the
foreground, so that breaks therein could be used to
indicate distance. More or less numerous jutting forks
of low lying land were thrown into the stream from
either side, this plan being successfully adopted in Italy,<a name="FNanchor_A_434" id="FNanchor_A_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_434" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Flanders,<a name="FNanchor_B_435" id="FNanchor_B_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_435" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> and Germany.<a name="FNanchor_C_436" id="FNanchor_C_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_436" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>Early in the sixteenth century much improvement
was made in the use of water for providing distance, and
a few of the Venetian painters gave some consideration
to aerial perspective, but the most perfect example of this
perspective in the period is contained in an early work of
Raphael.<a name="FNanchor_D_437" id="FNanchor_D_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_437" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> In the background is a lake extending into a
gradually deepening haze, and in this a boat is so skilfully
placed as to increase considerably the apparent
distance to the horizon. This picture is a distinct
advance upon the Venetian distance work of the time.<a name="FNanchor_E_438" id="FNanchor_E_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_438" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Later on in the century an artist rarely introduced water
into a view specially to assist in producing distance by
means of boats, more advanced methods being adopted.
Titian used sunlight effects with varying shadows,<a name="FNanchor_F_439" id="FNanchor_F_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_439" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>alternating clear and wooded ground.<a name="FNanchor_G_440" id="FNanchor_G_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_440" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> These plans, and
the use of water with the addition of trees and low hills,<a name="FNanchor_H_441" id="FNanchor_H_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_441" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
constitute the chief devices to be found in the late sixteenth-century
Italian pictures. Some of the sun effects
rendered for distance purposes even before Titian's best
time are quite effective, though formal.<a name="FNanchor_I_442" id="FNanchor_I_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_442" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p>Lessing apparently overlooked the possibilities of
landscape painting in his dictum as to progressive actions.
He writes<a name="FNanchor_D_443" id="FNanchor_D_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_443" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If painting on account of the signs and means of imitation
which it employs, and which can only be combined in space, must
entirely renounce time, then progressive actions cannot, in so far as
they are progressive, be included in the number of its subjects, but
it must content itself with coexistent actions, or with mere bodies,
which on account of their position cause an action to be suspected.</p></div>

<p class="noin">It is true that a series of progressive human actions cannot
be included in one painting, but progressive natural
actions can be so included when the progression is regular
and repeated and the actions are clearly separated to
the eye. Although the painter can only depict a moment
of time, he can show the whole progression, which is
not the case in a series of human actions, as in the example
quoted by Lessing, of Pandarus arranging his bow, opening
his quiver, choosing an arrow, and so on.</p>

<p>Strange to say, De Quincey, in an explanatory note to
Lessing's observations, also overlooks the movement of
water broken by rocks, though he refers specially to landscape
painting. He says<a name="FNanchor_E_444" id="FNanchor_E_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_444" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>In the succession of parts which make up appearance in nature,
either the parts simply repeat each other (as in the case of a man
walking, a river flowing, etc.), or they unfold themselves through
a cycle, in which each step effaces the preceding, as in the case of a
gun exploding, where the flash is swallowed up by the smoke
effaced by its own dispersion.</p></div>

<p class="noin">But for the purpose of the painter, the action of water
breaking over ledges and boulders does not correspond
with the case of a man walking or a river flowing, because
the series of events forming the progression in the case
of the water breaking, cover such time and space that the
events can be distinctly separated by the eye. Clearly
also this action should not be included in De Quincey's
second category, because the repetition is both regular
and (to all intents and purposes) perpetual. There
should therefore be a third category to comprise those
repeated progressive acts in which the events can be so
separated by the eye as to be portrayed on canvas in the
order of their progression, and in such a way that the
whole progression, and the meaning of it, are at once
apparent.</p>

<p>Professor Clausen relates that Whistler told him that
his object in painting nocturnes was to try and exhibit
the "mystery and beauty of the night." It is obvious
that Whistler was here confusing psychological with
visual impressions. The depth of gloom, the apparently
limitless dark void which the eye cannot penetrate, mean
mystery in a sense, because we can never accustom ourselves
to the suggestion of infinity involved in something
which is boundless to the senses. A sensation of the
sublime may consequently arise, and this means beauty
in a psychological sense. But we are considering art
and not psychology. Where nothing is distinguished, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>thing
can be painted, and if there be sufficient light for
objects to be determined, there can be no mystery for
the painter. If he be desirous of representing Night, he
must follow the example of Michelangelo and symbolize it.</p>

<p>It is curious that since the death of Whistler, a picture
entitled Mysteries of the Night has been painted by
another American artist&mdash;J. H. Johnston. A figure of a
beautiful nude woman is standing on a rocky shore in a
contemplative attitude, with the moonlight thrown upon
her. The design is excellent, but the realistic modelling
of the figure effectually kills any suggestion of mystery.</p>

<p>Vasari mentions that Michelangelo, though admiring
the colour and manner of Titian regretted that the
Venetian painters did not pay more attention to drawing
in their studies.<a name="FNanchor_A_445" id="FNanchor_A_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_445" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> In quoting this, Reynolds observed<a name="FNanchor_B_446" id="FNanchor_B_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_446" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But if general censure was given to that school from the sight
of a picture by Titian, how much more heavily and more justly
would the censure fall on Paolo Veronese, and more especially on
Tintoretto.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Reynolds himself rightly excluded Titian when he condemned
the later Venetian painters of the Renaissance
for their exaggeration of colour, and no doubt Titian was
also exempted by J. A. Symonds in his trenchant criticism
of the work of this school. When dealing with the
decline of Lesbian poetry after the brilliant period of
Sappho, he wrote<a name="FNanchor_C_447" id="FNanchor_C_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_447" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this the Lesbian poets were not unlike the Proven&ccedil;al
troubadours, who made a literature of love, or the Venetian painters,
who based their art on the beauty of colour, the voluptuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
charms of the flesh. In each case the motive of enthusiastic passion
sufficed to produce a dazzling result. But as soon as its freshness
was exhausted there was nothing left for art to live on, and
mere decadence to sensuality ensued.</p></div>

<p>Sir George Beaumont relates of Reynolds<a name="FNanchor_A_448" id="FNanchor_A_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_448" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On his return from his second tour over Flanders and Holland,
he observed to me that the pictures of Rubens appeared much less
brilliant than they had done on his former inspection. He could
not for some time account for this little circumstance; but when
he recollected that when he first saw them he had his notebook
in his hand for the purpose of writing down short remarks, he
perceived what had occasioned their now making a less impression
than they had done formerly. By the eye passing immediately
from the white paper to the picture, the colours derived uncommon
richness and warmth; but for want of this foil they afterwards
appeared comparatively cold.</p></div>

<p>Rodin<a name="FNanchor_B_449" id="FNanchor_B_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_449" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> observes that in giving movement to his personages,
the artist</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>represents the transition from one pose to another&mdash;he indicates
how insensibly the first glides into the second. In his work we
still see a part of what was, and we discover a part of what is to
be.</p></div>

<p>Rodin points to Rude's fine statue of Marshal Ney,
and practically says that here the illusion is created by a
series of progressive actions indicated in the attitude:
the legs remaining as they were when the sword was
about to be drawn, and the hand still holding the scabbard
away from the body, while the chest is being
thrown out and the sword held aloft. Thus the sculptor</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>compels, so to speak, the spectator to follow the development of
an act in an individual. The eyes are forced to travel upwards
from the lower limbs to the raised arm, and as in so doing they
find the different parts of the figure represented at successive
instants, they have the illusion of beholding the movement
performed.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Rodin himself has followed a similar course with much
success. The ancient Greek sculptors, when representing
a figure in action, invariably chose a moment of rest
between two progressive steps in the action. The
Discobolus and Marsyas of Myron, and particularly the
Atalanta in the Louvre, are fine examples.</p>

folds, whether an arm or a leg has been moved forwards or backwards
into the attitude which it actually occupies; whether a limb
has been, or is being, moved from a contracted position into a
straightened one, or whether it was extended at first and is being
contracted.</p></div>

R. Phillimore writes<a name="FNanchor_D_455" id="FNanchor_D_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_455" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is not difficult to imagine the picture of an old man-of-war
towed by a steam tug up a river. The execution of such a subject
may deserve great praise and give great satisfaction to the beholder.
But add to the representation the statement that it is "The fighting
Temeraire towed to her last berth, " and a series of the most stirring
events of our national history fills our imagination.</p></div>

<p>There is an antique sculptured group in the Vatican in
which a precisely similar figure of the son of Niobe has
his left hand on the shoulder of his sister who has fallen
to her knees from the effect of a wound, and it is very
reasonably suggested that the Florence figure originally
formed part of a like group. But the explanation of the
act given by Perry<a name="FNanchor_E_456" id="FNanchor_E_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_456" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> and others, that the drapery was
raised by the brother to shield the girl, will scarcely hold
good, as the folds are spread out at the back, forming a
concavity, whereas they would fall loosely if the youth
were resting. Apart from this, his legs are widely separated,
and in a running position. It may therefore be
surmised that in the Vatican group the artist intended
to represent the precise moment when the fleeing youth
reached his sister.</p>

<p>It is curious that among the countless pictures of the
Annunciation, in very few indeed has surprise been
expressed in the countenance and attitude of the Virgin,
though it is impossible to imagine an incident more
properly calling for profound astonishment on the part
of the principal personage in a composition, even in the
absence of startling miraculous accessories such as that
introduced by Rossetti. Probably the reason for this is
connected with the difficulty of expressing great surprise
unaccompanied with some other feeling, as pleasure, or
sorrow, or fear, but there does not seem to be any cause
why an exalted joyful excitement should not be exhibited.
Mrs. Jameson thinks that the Virgin should not appear
startled, as She was "accustomed to the perpetual ministry
of Angels who daily and hourly attended on Her,"<a name="FNanchor_A_457" id="FNanchor_A_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_457" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
but it is questionable whether this can be properly
assumed by the artist, and in any case from the point of
view of art, the action should correspond with the nature
of the event as it is generally understood. Of the few
masters who have indicated surprise in an Annunciation
picture, Tintoretto has gone the farthest. He shows
the Virgin with Her lips parted, and both hands held up,
evidently with astonishment,<a name="FNanchor_B_458" id="FNanchor_B_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_458" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> an example followed by
Paris Bordone.<a name="FNanchor_C_459" id="FNanchor_C_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_459" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Raphael in an early picture represents
Her holding up one hand, but the attitude might signify
the reception of an announcement of importance.<a name="FNanchor_D_460" id="FNanchor_D_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_460" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> Perugino
shows Her with both hands raised, but otherwise
She appears unconcerned.<a name="FNanchor_E_461" id="FNanchor_E_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_461" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> A few other artists,
including Venusti and Foppa, and among modern men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>Girodet, adopt Raphael's method of composition. Rubens
goes a step farther, and represents the Virgin apparently
standing back with surprise, though this is only
faintly suggested by the facial expression.<a name="FNanchor_F_462" id="FNanchor_F_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_462" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
